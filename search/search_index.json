This is partially true, and the prince had the audacity to tell that to \"Eskil\". [[Eskil]] reminds the Prince that he is a god. The Prince again rebuffs the covenant that the princes of Eskillia had kept for tens of generation. [[Eskil]]reveals his true name to the Prince. He reveals to the prince the origins of universe, and that [[Eskil]]would be rash with his punishment. [[Eskil]]turns the stone to dust, and inflicts the ashblight  on the people of Eskillia.

[Tomakin attempt to make conversation with ale-guzzler, an aged [Pevolia]]n wearing a brown cloak, but the man didn't seem much in conversation. [[Tomakin]] left the bar, and reunited with [[Pops]] and [[Lorenzo]]. Maybe noticing this interaction, [Oren approached the bar. He sat next to the weary, drunk Pevolian and asked if he was okay. The [Pevolian]]  gave a vague response, but appreciated [Oren the Archer's gesture. The [Pevolian]] man, named Sergey, placed his hand on [[Oren]] shoulder as a gesture of good nature. When he lifted up his arm, his cloak fell back on his arm, revealing tattoos. These tattoos similar to what [[Jericho]] had, the magical tattoos that belonged to the group that stole [[Oren]]'s brothers. [[Oren]] froze for a moment and immediately walked a way from the bar. He wanted to fight him, but he remembered [[Pops]] words. [[Oren]] wanted answers more. [[Oren]] confided with [[Mako]] and [[Tomakin]]. They got Sergey even more drunk, and took him back to his room. There [[Oren]] knocked him out and [[Tomakin]] looted the room (earning them an employee card as well). The successfully snuck Sergey all the way to the belly of the Teknesi. Sergey was tied up, as he came to. Sergey was his drunk self but a moment. As soon as [[Oren]] questioned him about his tattoos, he got silent. The drunk forgetting his troubles shifted. Shifted to a man who remembered everything he had done. [[Oren]] question him using torture. [[Oren]] got the name of the group that took his family: \"Way of [[Jinn]]\".</p> <p>[[Jinn]] being the leader, but it was not really clear if \"[[Jinn]]\" was still alive or if it had just become a title. When Sergey revealed that those who were kidnapped became child soldiers, [[Oren]] cut off his ear. Sergey was pretty forthcoming with information, if a little panicked for obvious reasons. He even offered [Oren a contact in [Pevolia]] . Sergey wanted his freedom now however, and [[Oren]] was not going to let that happen, fearing Sergey could provoke [[Giocar]] into attacking the Teknesi. No, there Sergey would remain until the ship set sail, or for who knows how long. [[Tomakin]] was sent to tell [[Lorenzo]] of the news. At this point however, there were developments inside the ship as [[Giocar]] was about to make his entrance into the main dining hall and potentially change the power-balance of Barcazoan politics forever.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-1/#episode-11","title":"Episode 11:","text":"<p>[[Giocar]] exited his meeting room and entered the main hall of The Grand Reale. Puzzled, he walked over to [[Lorenzo]]'s table. He climbed over the table just to get a better look at [[Lorenzo]]'s face. [[Giocar]] remarked that [[Lorenzo]] was thinner in real life than in his bounty photo. [[Giocar]] gave a hearty laugh. He invited [[Lorenzo]] to a meeting that would be happening later. [[Lorenzo]] was completely unaware that [[Giocar]] had discovered that the Sweet Leaf was on the Teknesi. Speaking of back on the Teknesi, [[Oren]] sat in shock of what had just happened. His guilt over came him and he vomited in the corner of the room. [[Oren]] realized that what he had did was wrong. [[Oren]] wanted to turn himself in, but [[Mako]] discouraged him, knowing that his friend would be at the mercy of [[Giocar]]. Determined, [[Oren]] decided to turn himself in anyway. [[Oren]] freed Sergey and rushed to find medical attention. After Sergey was handed over to the ship's guards, [[Oren]] met his fate in front of [[Giocar]]. From a distance, the crew watched [[Giocar]]'s judgement of the archer. [[Giocar]] was angry but with his usual [[Giocar]] flair. He offered [[Oren]] a choice: either lose his ear or fight The Grand Reale's champion in the arena. [[Oren]] agreed to the fight, once again trusting his instinct over the crew.</p> <p>While the crew waited for [[Oren]]'s match to start, the gang hung out in the main hall of The Grand Reale. [[Tomakin]] won some money at cards. [[Mako]] got some information from his former coworker Stefan. Once [[Giocar]] heard that the leaf was onboard, he had conspired with [[Mako]] and [[Oliviero]] in order to personally deal the leaf. This obviously frustrated [[Mako]], but Stefan reassured him that he would get his cut. [[Lorenzo]] meanwhile tried to soften up [[Oren]]'s opponent, but to no avail. Some time passed and it was time for [[Oren]]'s trial by combat to begin. [[Tomakin]] asked his angel-dad to help [[Oren]], and angel-dad agreed. [[Mako]] lent his poison to [[Oren]]. Furthermore, [[Mako]] used his special ability and cursed Jon, the opponent, before the match. Giocar gave his hand signal, and the match began! [[Oren]] launched an arrow at Jon. Jon prepared to knock the arrow out of the air, as he had done many times before in the arena. This time however the arrow struck him dead in the chest (his timing was off because of the curse). Jon dove behind cover and healed himself. Jon peaked out to try to spot his opponent. A poison tipped arrow hit the side of his cheek. [[Oren]] was spot on with his marksmanship. Jon charged at [[Oren]], deflecting some arrows but others still struck him. By the time he was finally close to [[Oren]], Jon was very wounded. As Jon was finally ready to lay a hit on [[Oren]] with his bowstaff, [[Mako]] yelled out, \"Behind you!\" This briefly distracted Jon, allowing [[Oren]] to punch Jon out. [[Oren]] stood over him as the surprise victor. When Jon woke up, the effects of the curse had worn off. While [[Oren]] offered respect to Jon, Jon had little interest. Jon walked away bewildered and angry. Jon hit one of the stone barriers with his bowstaff and it went flying. \"Next time, just wait until I get one hit in.\"</p> <p>[[Giocar]] enjoyed the spectacle and proceeded to head back to the meeting room with [[Nico]] Myotos, Geraldo Koleci, [[Lorenzo]] Pierro, and [[Chris]]. Everyone had different expectations going into the meeting. [[Giocar]] wanted one thing from it all however. Years ago, [Giocar was a for-hire captain that worked with the 7 great families of [Sidio Barca]] . After some dispute, [[Giocar]] broke off ties even stealing some of the trade families ships. In the present, [[Giocar]] wanted a seat at the table. He wants to found the 8th trade family, one bound not by blood but brotherhood. Now [[Nico]] and [[Lorenzo]] both objected to this. [[Giocar]] had leverage. He knew about [[Lorenzo]]'s spice below deck and [[Nico]] needed [Giocar's help in order to push the Koleci out of southern [Mildabian]] seas. Geraldo was just going to get screwed no matter what. The talks went back and forth and seemed at a standstill. One thing remained a constant: [[Giocar]] wanted to etch himself into history. Meanwhile the crew returned back to the ship without [[Lorenzo]]. The ship still docked on the back of The Grand Reale. While some rested others noticed the guards of The Grand Reale getting closer and closer.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-1/#episode-12","title":"Episode 12:","text":"<p>[[Lorenzo]] and [[Giocar]] finally reached an agreement. [[Giocar]] paid [[Lorenzo]] 1,000 Silver up front. In exchange, he would deliver the remaining 2 barrels and collect the fee from the Pevolian government (which will be much less than he thinks it is). [Nico got control of the Southern [Mildabian]]  seas, and the Koleci got nothing. Patriarch Geraldo Koleci begged [[Lorenzo]] to take his side and help him. [[Lorenzo]], not a big fan of the slaver, said \"No.\" The crew set sail from THE GRAND REALE. However, they realized that they were being followed. [[Lorenzo]] sent [[Chris]] out to check. He returned, wounded by a large arrow, but holding the flag of the Koleci. They were chasing the Teknesi, and they had many a reason. Geraldo was obviously angry at [[Lorenzo]] for not taking his side in the meeting. Also, the Teknesi had plenty of treasure and spices aboard. Furthermore, [[Mako]] was onboard and he was rumored to have collected contracts against the Koleci family. The Teknesi, through [Lorenzo's navigation, out-maneuvered the Koleci ship and made it to [Mildabian]]  shores. The Koleci ship feared international incident and waited on the horizon for the Teknesi to leave port.</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] made a great leap in discovery in his book. Long ago, there were four peoples. The Kwy (glowing eyes), the humans (sha), the mer, and the Pan. The Pan and the Kwy had a big war. Shortly after that war, horrible monsters came and destroyed much of the world. The Pan stood up in defense, but suffered many casualties. These warrior Pan took a different appearance than the old Pans (having glowing eyes and even longer ornate horns). Eventually, these warrior Pan defeated the monsters and the books end. No one really understands what [[Oliviero]] book means. It sounds like a fairy-tale. Anyway, once the crew arrives at this safe port. They realize they are at a magic school. There they learn that [[Jericho]] was seriously injured in the party's attack. The party was welcomed inside. </p> <p>The crew was at a magical school, dedicated to raising first responders for the Diacci church. They witnessed a grand demonstration from Professor Patel, who even invited them to view the campus library. The crew soon set out, but the Koleci ship remained on the horizon. [[Lorenzo]] elected to try diplomacy. He sent [[Mako]] with a letter to start the negotiations. Unfortunately, the Koleci weren't interested in negotiation. A cannonball nearly missed [[Mako]] and he soon was hit by an arrow, shot by Zarar the Manhunter (slaver and high-ranking Koleci family member). A portal fell into the ocean. And [[Mako]] fell into it. There [[Mako]] met a mysterious girl with horns and glowing eyes. Her name was Inopia. She offered [[Mako]] power to beat those who oppressed orphans in exchange for losing some of his humanity. [[Mako]] accepted and emerged up from the portal of the sea with glowing, sunken purple eyes.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-1/#episode-13","title":"Episode 13:","text":"<p>[[Mako]] emerged from the sea using his new found powers to counter attack Zarar. After taking more cannon fire, [[Mako]] retreats. Meanwhile the Koleci ship fired at the docked Teknesi. One nearly collided, but [[Oliviero]] blocked it with a wave. A second shot sailed over the Teknesi, hitting the college and collapsing the roof. Professor Patel came rushing out. [[Lorenzo]] explained that the ship was under attack from the Koleci Slavers. Patel offered to help. They decided that the best bet was for a small vessel to board the ship and takeout the Koleci crew. Professor Patel, two of his best students, [[Oliviero]], [[Oren]], and [[Pops]] + [[Mako]] who was still water walking.</p> <p>They boarded the ship successfully. [[Oren]] rushed to the Koleci captain. [[Pops]], Patel, and the students took on the crew below deck. [[Oliviero]] and [[Mako]] disarmed the cannons. Zarar was knocked off the ship and into the water by an arrow. [[Mako]] and Olivierro fought him below deck. [[Mako]] became exhausted from his borrowed use of magic energy. [[Oliviero]] rushed in and stabbed Zarar while he was on fire, ending the fight. Meanwhile [[Tomakin]] saw [[Pops]] was cornered on the ship. He had [[Lorenzo]] pull the ship in and [[Tomakin]] rushed in to save [[Pops]]. He was successful. As the fight seemed to turn in our heroes favor, Geraldo Koleci was backed in to a corner. Him and [[Oren]] arranged a ceasefire. However, when it became clear that the slaver Koleci did not have much value for human life (2 died in the roof collapse btw), Professor Patel jumped in and placed him in a greater sealing rune which lasts a week. Professor Patel told the Teknesi crew to take whatever they wanted from the ship. The crew soon set sail, with Geraldo imprisoned by Professor Patel and the university.</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] spent some time training at the school following the victory. A week or so passes and the crew eventually arrived at the tip of the Eastern Continent. [[Mako]] knew this was where he needed to pick up his reward. It took much persuasion, but they did land there. [[Mako]] picked up his bounty and the crew bought some magical items from a vendor outside the outpost. [[Mako]] said his heartfelt goodbyes to the majority of the crew as they entered the building, paying for their first round. Outside, [[Mako]] picked up a bounty for an Eskilian Petty King, the perfect target. The Orphan in [[Mako]]'s head agreed. [[Mako]] went to pass by the ship one last time; [[Pops]] stood on the deck. [[Pops]] knew the deal that [[Mako]] had took; it was the same one that he had rejected all those years ago. [[Pops]] called out to [[Mako]], at first trying to be cordial. [[Pops]]: \"I wish you well, [[Mako]].\" [[Mako]]: \"Likewise!\" [[Pops]] is overcome with feelings of guilt. He had tried to lead [[Mako]] away from the pact. [[Pops]]: \"It's not too late to turn back you know. From the Tyrants. You have traded away yourself.\" [[Mako]]: \"That may be the case, but it was my deal to make.\" [[Pops]] let out a sigh. Not only had Denesi come to like [[Mako]], but [[Pops]] had too. [[Pops]]: \"Well, [[Mako]]. I hope when the war comes, when the Tyrants return, we won't meet on the battlefield.\" [[Pops]] went back below deck to be with Denesi. [[Mako]] walked away in silence.</p> <p>Inside the restaurant, the rest of the crew was living it up. Then, at the bar they saw a familiar face. It was Ulacham!

It was a joyous reunion. Soon the whole party came over for the reunion. Ulacham remarked how excited he was to be alive, and how lucky he was that his escape from the other High Aglthiims had been successful. There was much merriment. Oliviero relaxed in his chair, when he heard a plate crash. He looked and it appeared that a waitress had dropped a plate, but that waitress was nowhere to be found. After a few more minutes Oliviero noticed that patrons of the bar were blipping out of existence. He alerted the party, Ulacham didn't even acknowledge it happening. Lorenzo went to ask one of the remaining tables if they noticed what was going on, but they too disappeared. Soon it was just the party and Ulacham alone in the tavern-outpost. The sky darkened. The doors flew open. A figure draped in reds, coppers, and oranges entered the bar. He resembled the statues that the party had seen in [Mildabia]] . The High-Aglthiim \"[[Lucien]] - Nuzul Alnaar.\" He spoke calmly, some of his words intelligible because they were \"crackled\" (only understandable by [[Tomakin]]). [[Lucien]] said that Ulacham had betrayed the Diacci and that his fleeing proved his guilt. Ulacham responded saying that he had only betrayed [[Lucien]], but upon seeing [[Lucien]]'s masked face, Ulacham bowed his head in silence. [[Lucien]] approached Ulacham slowly. [[Lucien]] materialized a seven-foot blade of fire out of nothing. [[Lucien]] continued approaching Ulacham. Then in [[Tomakin]]'s head, his dad yelled at him to get down. [[Tomakin]] got on his hands and knees in reference. [[Oren]] begged [[Lucien]] to try and find a way other than violence, but [[Lucien]] responded, \"If there is no retribution for murder, there is no justice.\" [[Oliviero]] meanwhile was taking a more proactive approach.</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] prepared to cast the powerful spell that he had learned from his eonic tome. [[Lucien]] noticed the power that [[Oliviero]] was using, countered it with a wave of his hand, and blipped [[Oliviero]] out of existence. [[Lucien]] swung his sword with little force, but the blade of fire went straight through Ulacham. The arc of the sword stopped inches away from [[Tomakin]], who had been sitting next to Ulacham. Ulacham felt no pain, but one by one his atoms split apart from themselves and he ceased to exist. [[Lucien]] then blipped [[Oliviero]] back into existence, for he had business to address with the whole party. He explained that Ulacham's presence was a danger to all of Melia. That he was murderer, a fugitive. [[Lucien]] unfortunately had to relay the news to the party that they would lose all memory of this and their first encounter with Ulacham. [[Lorenzo]] and the crew begged [[Lucien]] to let them remember Ulacham as just a man. [[Lucien]] reluctantly obliged. [[Lucien]] also offered in consolation, secrets to the party. Each member chose to receive these secrets. [[Lorenzo]]'s: He was not the true heir, and one was above him on the line to succession. [[Oren]]'s: The location of his two brothers and the fact that one served [[Jinn]]. [[Oren]] asked if he was too far gone. [[Lucien]] responded by saying no one was too far gone. [[Oren]] called [[Lucien]] out on his hypocrisy leaving him silent. [[Tomakin]]'s: That his dad had really abandoned his mother, and also that his birthmark was a sealing symbol. [Oliviero's: That [Pevolia]] would be harsh and not what he expected. While in [[Oliviero]]'s mind [[Lucien]] also learned of the eonic tome that belonged to [[Oliviero]]. [[Lucien]] went to snap everyone's memories and vanished. [[Lucien]] did not realize however that [[Oliviero]] had prepped a counter rune on his skin that he triggered.

[[Oren]] got his bow engraved in town. [[Skee]], [[Oliviero]], and [[Tomakin]] saw a crowd and investigated. They were outside a Diacci temple. There were state military guards holding them back. The crowd said there was a monster inside; the guards said that they were under direct order to protect the person inside. [[Oliviero]] blinked him and his friend inside. Inside was a Half-thiim named Harim. He was very nice. He told them that he was on a special interfaith mission and was sent directly by [[Jericho]]. The guards were protecting him as he was also headed to the capitol. The guards realized their trick and escorted them out. They would have been in serious trouble, but when [[Oren]] came he recognized the resemblance. It was the blacksmith's brother. That connection got them out off trouble. In an alley, a guy named Dayson lured [[Oliviero]]. He told [[Oliviero]] about a big shipment of explosive material that the [[Jinn]] had stolen. [[Oliviero]] was sly. The rest of the party (sans [[Lorenzo]]) cornered Dayson and got him to lead them to the [[Jinn]] hideout. Unbeknownst to the party, [[Lorenzo]] was falling far behind trying to catch up.

Alexi is quickly on to the trick however. [[Tomakin]] sneaks in through the back door and attempted to get the jump on one of the thugs inside. He's successful, but the whole room erupts into chaos. Alexi flips the big table and ducks behind. [[Oliviero]] and [[Skee]] are sent flying back. Another [[Jinn]] thug climbs out of a fire place to fight [[Tomakin]].

[[Oren]] watches from a bay window, waiting to make his move. Meanwhile our favorite Captain and dinosaur duo had finally got up to the party. Puzzled about the whole situation, he looks inside the house. He does not understand what all the fighting is about? He watches through the window and sees [[Oren]] watching through the opposite window. Before [[Lorenzo]] can process this, a dagger comes flying from the woods from behind the safe house. It narrowly misses [[Lorenzo]]. Puzzling enough, this was not from the fight but rather from a hidden assassin in the woods (who we later find out is Killian Kaschek). [[Chris]] chased after Killian, but could not catch him. [[Lorenzo]] walked around back to where [[Oren]] was watching from. [[Oren]] explained the situation to [[Lorenzo]].</p> <p>[[Oliviero]]'s goal was simple: take as much of the accelerant for himself as possible. While [[Skee]] and [[Tomakin]] fought, [[Oliviero]] teleport in and out of the building with armfuls of accelerant. [[Oren]] tried to take a shot in through the window but missed. [[Skee]] charged Alexi like a dummy. Alexi used the power of his [[Jinn]] tattoos. He grabbed [[Skee]], held him against the ground, and hit him with a point-blank blast of air. The impact made the floor around them descend about 6 inches. [[Skee]] was knocked out in this one blow. [[Oren]] shot an iron-bouncer, this one hit it's mark, wounding Alexi and protecting [[Skee]] from more violence. At this point Alexi had become aware of [[Oliviero]]'s thieving scheme. Alexi waited for [[Oliviero]] to teleport out. Alexi stood over the last case of accelerant. When [[Oliviero]] teleported back in, Alexi threw a punch empowered by his [[Jinn]] tattoos. Again, a one-hit KO. Meanwhile, using his papersword, sea-hook, and dagger; [[Tomakin]] handled his two opponents. He turned his focus to protecting the unconscious [[Skee]] and [[Oliviero]]. [[Oren]] landed another arrow hit on Alexi. [[Tomakin]] and Alexi prepared to clash. \"[[Chris]] now!\" [[Chris]] flew in through the bay window and tackled Alexi. It was a critical hit! Alexi was held down by the pterodactyl, unable to fight. Our heroes had won the day. [[Skee]] was seriously injured. [[Oren]] rushed him to a hospital back in town, where Chad Micheal Igarson performed first aid. More than half of [[Skee]]'s ribs were broken. He would be in a medical brace and unable to fight for awhile. Meanwhile back at the safe house, the [[Jinn]] thugs were interrogated. The party learned about the history of [[Jinn]]... </p> <pre><code>[[Jinn]] Lore: [[Jinn]] claimed to be a god who had been frozen in time by a wizard of old. He awoke from a 500 year slumber to discover the world around him had changed. [[Jinn](&lt;./Melia-Mar-Biographics.md#pevolia&gt;) was a heathen. He wandered the Eastern Continent brawling, drinking, and was a one-man raiding party. His powers were impressive, besting even Aglthiims in combat. He soon grew a cult following. In part, he was empowered by god-like power but also his tattoos. He taught his followers about them. Pretty soon he had a sizeable army roaming the countryside, mainly in [Pevolia](&lt;./Melia-Mar-Biographics.md#pevolia&gt;) and [Lobreux]]. One day, [[Jinn]] lost a fight and was gravely wounded (his opponent's name is not uttered by [[Jinn]] followers). [[Jinn]] intended to one day return. He imparted a part of his consciousness to 6 of his followers. [[Jinn]]'s plan was that one day they would find a worthy vessel to reinsert his consciousness into. Instead, immediately after his death, one of the 6 followers killed another, stealing a par of [[Jinn]]'s consciousness. This follower is known as \"[[Jinn]] the Ruthless\" and will stop at nothing until he claims the rest of [[Jinn]]'s consciousness. The other followers remained scattered and have strained relationships. The only thing that binds them is the shared use of \"The Mines.\"\n</code></pre> <p>Above is the lore that Alexi told about the [[Jinn]]. How was he repaid for this information? He wasn't. The party instead turned the [[Jinn]] thugs over to the authorities (but not the accelerant, [[Oliviero]] kept that). Though this has not happened yet, the [[Jinn]] thugs were surely put to death, including the powerful Alexi. The party got a bounty, which [[Lorenzo]] split evenly. They waited a few more days in town, but soon, the train arrived.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-2/#arc-2-episode-4","title":"Arc 2 Episode 4:","text":"<p>The gang waited at the gate for the train. It was very crowded with all sorts of people. Businessmen, mages, poor workers, Arezian protestors (hippies). [[Lorenzo]] pays a little extra in exchange for their bags and barrels not to be checked. The Accelerant and Sweet Leaf remained concealed in the back of the train. [[Chris]] looks after the supplies. The gang gets on the train and gets a tour from the Conductor, [[Leona]] Trotsa. [[Lorenzo]] quickly put on the moves and at the very least she seems flatters. She takes them to the engine room. Although, there's not really an engine at all. Instead 5 mages are concentrating on fire and surrounded by runes. The fire is a pale grey and does not appear to be putting off any heat. [[Oliviero]] made a comment on that it didn't seem to be a strong fire. [[Leona]] laughed explaining that the fire was very powerful, so powerful that it did not appear on the visible spectrum. If the mages lost concentration, a blinding flash would happen that would be visible for miles. [[Oren]] question how such a fire was possible. [[Oliviero]], remembering one of his classes, explained that the mages were creating a portal to a sphere/plane of pure fire and allowing that heat to be drawn in. [[Leona]] was dumbstruck that [[Oliviero]] had figured out the power of the train so quickly. She did not have much time to dwell on that however, as [[Lorenzo]] continued to flirt.  </p> <p>They were seated in a comfortable part of the train, but not in the most lavish cars. [[Leona]] went back to check in with the engineers (mages). Meanwhile the rest of the gang decided to go explore the back part of the train, everyone except [[Oren]]. [[Oren]] instead observed the car he was already in. He understood some of the soldiers sitting next to him. They were Pevolian soldiers complaining about being deployed to the border. They complained about the walk and leaving home. This did not really stand out to [Oren at the time.</p> <p>So the rest of the gang explored the rest of the train. They found that the back part of the train was segregated to the poor and the religious minority Diacci. In the back most car before the storage cars, the party was reunited with Harim the Half-thiim. Harim told the party that one of the reason that he was going to [Pevolia]] was to search for \"[[Lorenzo]] Pierro\" whom [[Jericho]] had some questions for. Harim did not realize that [[Lorenzo]] was right in front of him however. [[Lorenzo]] and the rest of the party headed back to their seats. In the mean time, [[Oren]] saw someone give up a seat for an elderly passenger. At first he did not recognize this person, but then he did. It was his childhood friend, Vidalia. He did not speak; he was too surprised. Instead she ran over to where he was sitting. \"Oren, little [[Oren]]?\" she said with joy. They had a nice reunion. Vidalia explained that her older sister had gotten a job in Pevolia, and that she was going to visit her. She also told [[Oren]] tales of the mountainside, that his parents were doing alright. She also told [[Oren]] that Althorn had returned. But it was not a happy reunion. While he had escaped the [[Jinn]], he had become corrupted by a new power (that of the Abyss of the Ageless but Vidalia didn't know it). He had used that power to escape, but now it had taken a hold of him. Althorn and his father had gotten into an argument. His father begged him to stay, but Althorn knew that he couldn't. He bore the tattoos of the [[Jinn]] on his arm; he would never be accepted by any Lobrexian on the mountainside. Furthermore, his new power was beckoning him far away, and he knew he had to listen. [[Oren]] was glad to know that his brother was still alive, but heartbroken that this power had overtaken him. At about this time, the rest of the party returned to the car before [[Oren]]'s. When all of a sudden, like a loud speaker PA, they heard this:</p> <p>\"It is I Killian Kaschek of the Kaschek Bounty Hunting Clan. I have come to collect the bounty on your head '[[Lorenzo]] Pierro:.\"</p> <p>[[Lorenzo]] immediately threw off his captain hat, cloak, and other finer garments until he was only wearing a tank top and some pants. The party and him ran to see [[Oren]] to ask him what to do. \"What kind of man has a bounty like that and on a train?\" Vidalia asked [[Oren]]. [[Oren]] sighed. [[Lorenzo]] continued running. He had deduced that there was a far greater chance that the bounty hunter was in the back part of the train than the front. [[Leona]] stopped him on the connector that connected to one of the fancier cars. Leona asked what was all this about a bounty. [[Lorenzo]] was quick on his feet and went in for a kiss. (In game Liz rolled a nat-20) [[Lorenzo]] then told Leona that she had to help hide him. Leona rushed him to the engine room and hid him in a hidden compartment. Meanwhile a fight was brewing. Dogs made of smoke had tracked [[Lorenzo]]'s sent and the party all mpelled like him. [[Tomakin]] and [[Oliviero]] beat back the dogs, while [[Oren]] protected [[Skee]] and Vidalia. Soon Killian Kaschek himself, with an ally came busting through the car door. Killian was dressed in a nice jacket and wore a tophat. He immediately started throwing daggers at the party. Meanwhile his ally (down on his luck priest, Olgo York) casts buffs on him. It was a smaller battle. [[Oliviero]] and [[Tomakin]] were able to pretty well handle it without any help. Killian Kaschek abandoned Olgo and ran out the breached door that he entered. Meanwhile however [[Chris]] snuck off behind him, and pushed him off the train which was going well over 100 mph. Killian died on impact. Once again the party had saved the day. Leona escorted [[Lorenzo]] back to his car after another kiss.</p> <p>The gang was reunited. [[Oren]] and Vidalia had fled to a car closer to the engine to talk privately. Vidalia expressed concern that [[Oren]]'s adventuring was dangerous and that she was worried about him. [[Oren]] promised Vidalia that he'd be safe. Meanwhile one car back, the party met with the defeated Olgo York. Olgo explained that he was just a poor priest who badly needed money. He didn't want to harm anyone. [[Lorenzo]] offered him a job, and Olgo said that he'd consider. He even healed the party some too. At this point the hair on the back of [[Oliviero]]'s neck stood up again, like it did when he was around those corrupted by the Abyss of the Ageless. Things were looking well. The train went into a tunnel, but it quickly became apparent that something was blocking the exit. A rock slide? That's what the mage-engineers thought. They slowed the train down and approached the exit with caution. As they go closer, the entrance reopened. Puzzling but they continued to move forward slowly. As soon as the train cleared the exit, it became apparent what had been blocking the exit: a 4-story tall stone elemental. This elemental had red glowing eyes that resembled that of [[Mako]]'s after he had become corrupted. The elemental took a swipe at the train.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-2/#arc-2-episode-5","title":"Arc 2 Episode 5:","text":"<p>The front car of the train collapses.

In the next car back was the party, the conductor, and Olgo the Priest. Their was minimal damage to this car aside from a beam that fell. The beam nearly hit [[Tomakin]] in his head, but a bubble of protection surrounded him just a second before that could happen. A gift from his father. The remaining cars were all tipped-partially over, still inside of the tunnel, but those passengers were okay. The party reunited after the wreck. Standing in front of them and the crowd of stranded passengers was a giant Stone Elemental. It had glowing red eyes, which [[Oliviero]] knew was not normal. The eyes stared back at them menacingly. Meanwhile Leona drank a potion, that gave her super strength and began to rescue those still trapped in the wreckage.</p> <p>The party squared up to fight the elemental. [[Chris]] did a quick fly-over while [[Tomakin]] rushed to the back to get explosives to blow the monster up. [[Oliviero]] took a much more proactive approach. From the text that he had been deciphering his entire journey, there was a spell that he could barely comprehend, but he felt that it was needed here. He began to cast it. Meanwhile the elemental backhanded [[Chris]] and sent him flying back to [[Lorenzo]]. [[Lorenzo]] realized that this was not a fight that they could not win and joined the wreckage survivors that were running away. [[Oliviero]] casted his spell. Channeling all of his energy dirt and rocks began to lift off the ground around him in swirling column expanding outward. The particles twisted up into the sky above the elemental forming a meteor. Just as [[Oliviero]] began to lose control of the spiral, he dropped the meteor on the elemental, crushing it. The shockwave sent people and debris flying. The elemental, clearly wounded got back up however. At this point [[Oren]] got Vidalia to safety and then began to shoot the monster with his bow.</p> <p>[[Tomakin]] emerge from the cave with the accelerant. He had a plan, exploded next to or inside the elemental to do massive damage. After [[Oliviero]]'s massive attack the elemental targeted him, throwing a large rock. [[Oliviero]] adeptly blinked out of the path. However, he did not return. Instead he was trapped in the In-Between. At first all [[Oliviero]] saw in the In-Between was the usual endless blackness. Then he saw a pair of glowing eyes, like the eyes of the elemental. As soon as the eyes locked with [[Oliviero]], a creature stood in front of him. It stood twice [[Oliviero]]'s heights. Like a man, but not. It had sharp teeth and horns that wrapped around many times like those of a goat on the side of its head. It spoke: \"I am [[Eblis]], Defender of Melia and the Tyrant of Tyrants. You have something that belongs to me.\" [[Oliviero]] had faced down foes much stronger than himself before, but none like this. [[Eblis]] could tell [[Oliviero]] was tense an explained that they could not harm each other in the In-Between. \"I just want to talk,\" [[Eblis]] said. [[Oliviero]] put his shoulders back. [[Eblis]] explained that eons ago, he had been a mage like [[Oliviero]]. The book in [[Oliviero]]'s possession was written by [[Eblis]], perhaps in a past life, and now [[Eblis]] wanted it back. [[Oliviero]] was very intrigued. Finally, a figure that he had seen in the ancient text was right in front of him in the flesh, the author even! But [[Oliviero]] was not ready to give up his tome. It contained powerful spells and information relative to the history of the universe. [[Oliviero]] asked why it was so important for the book to be returned. [[Eblis]] explained that contained inside the book were spells far too powerful for the mortals of the current generation. These spells would corrupt and could destroy the world if misused. [[Eblis]] used the example of [[Oliviero]]'s shockwave dealing damage to innocent bystanders as an example. In [[Oliviero]]'s mind, he had casted that to protect them, and the alternative would have been worse.</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] declined [[Eblis]]'s deal. [[Eblis]] responded, that the book would be in his possession either way. [[Oliviero]] was released from the In-Between, appearing back on the battlefield. Without missing a beat, he aided [[Tomakin]]'s plan of getting the explosives in the elemental's maw. [[Tomakin]] stealthily ran up and in one fell swoop scaled the elemental and placed it in its mouth. Before he could celebrate and before [[Oliviero]] could detonate the accelerant, the elemental took a wide swipe that was about to hit both of them. [[Oliviero]] had no choice but to, blink both he and [[Tomakin]], back into the In-Between. Unfortunately, he was hit in the process knocking him unconscious There [[Tomakin]] too met the ferocious [[Eblis]]. [[Eblis]] explained his plight to [[Tomakin]], who was more sympathetic. [[Tomakin]] began to turn on [[Oliviero]], but [[Oliviero]] snapped him out of it. Soon they teleported back to the real world, but this time on the mountainside with a vantage point on the elemental. [[Oliviero]] was unconscious. [[Tomakin]] rummaged through his bag and found the book. Meanwhile, [[Oren]] was able to shoot an arrow and detonate the explosives. Also Harim, after healing many survivors joined the fight. Harim fired off round after round of lightning bolts that did considerable damage to the elemental. [[Tomakin]] made a choice. He hid the book under a rock. He instead grabbed a different book from [[Oliviero]]'s bag and set it on fire. [[Tomakin]] called out to the stone elemental that was possessed by [[Eblis]]. The elemental scaled the mountainside to see the book being burned. [[Oren]] and Harim landed good attacks on it while this was happening. The elemental saw the burning book, but [[Eblis]] was not convinced that this was his book. The elemental was weakened however. [[Tomakin]] jumped on the elemental's head as it tumbled down the mountainside. [[Tomakin]] pleaded that he really had destroyed the book, but this made [[Eblis]] have even more doubts. With one last lightning bolt from Harim, the elemental died.</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] awoke to the smoldering ashes of a book in front of him he was angry and grieved the loss of such history. [[Tomakin]] scaled the mountain and found the young mage. [[Oliviero]] did not want to speak to him at first, fearful of what he might say. [[Tomakin]] kept trying to explain what happened, but [[Oliviero]] would not hear any of it. Finally [[Tomakin]] showed [[Oliviero]], that the book was still intact. [[Oliviero]] had the biggest smile. In the aftermath of the battle, Harim and [[Oren]] were hailed as heroes. [[Chris]], [[Lorenzo]], and [[Skee]] regrouped with the rest of the team. Vidalia and much of the other passengers were safe, however many of the engineer-mages did not make it. [[Leona]] explained that there was not a chance that the train, which lay on its side, would run again. They were about halfway to the capitol, but the remainder of the journey would be a long walk. [[Tomakin]] grabbed the cart and the remaining mule. The party and the survivors began their long walk to the capitol.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-2/#arc-2-episode-6","title":"Arc 2 Episode 6:","text":"<p>Oren was having a terrible dream as he took rest on the cart. Was it dream or was he seeing the past through someone else's eyes? In his dream, [[Oren]] was his brother, Althorn. He was running from the [[Jinn]], but tripped and fell. They caught up with him and captured him again. Althorn was tied down he looked to his left and saw the tattoo that the [[Jinn]] had forced onto his arm. He was about to experience some barbaric form of punishment when a soothing voice called out to him. He was wisped away to the In-Between. A gentle hand touch his face. The voice promised Althorn that if he helped her, she would free him from the chains and the bonds of the [[Jinn]]. [[Oren]] as Althorn tried to say \"no\" but in the dream, Althorn blurted out \"yes.\" [[Oren]] knew this was the call of the abyss of the ageless, of a tyrant. [[Oren]] awoke from his nightmare. [[Skee]] had climbed inside of the cart to check on him. [[Skee]] asked [[Oren]] if he was having bad dreams again. [[Oren]] replied yes, and then said that they were getting worse.</p> <p>After about a week and some days, the party made it to the gates of Visegrad, the capitol of Pevolia. The party had made it to the gates, but they were heavily guarded. [[Lorenzo]] knew not how much the lower level of the military knew about his deal with General Kutzov. On top of this, they still had some accelerant onboard the cart which [[Lorenzo]] knew was stolen directly from the military. He concocted a strategy to explain that the cart had dead bodies infected with the ashblight that needed to burn. [[Tomakin]] noticed how uncomfortable this made [[Skee]]. [[Tomakin]] directly asked [[Skee]] why he was acting this way. [[Skee]] explained that his father who had abandoned [[Skee]]'s family was infected with the ashblight, and passed it to his mother and also to [[Skee]] and his sibling. [[Skee]] explained that the ashblight only affects the individual once they've died. It brings them back as a shell of their former self. At first this is manageable, but after about a handful of years it drags the infected into a violent, unfeeling madness. The party all tried to comfort [[Skee]]. [[Lorenzo]]'s plan (thanks to [[Oren]]'s ad-libbing) works and they arrive in the city. [[Lorenzo]] decides that he wants to stay in a nice hotel in the upper part of the city, far a way from the poor whom live out by the gates. He rents a very nice inn, and the party has some time to relax in the the city. Here are there stories:</p> <p>[[Oliviero]] had finally made it to the College of Magic in Pevolia. His course was slightly altered. He was hesitant to talk much about his book. His plan began to shift. Why was he here? Maybe it was enough to just learn more about magic. [[Oliviero]] walked the through the courtyards and through the halls to the professor's corner. The students he saw were different from the ones at his old college back in Rocevelen. This was not the multicultural magic hub of his old school. It was housed by a vast majority of Pevolian students, and their uniforms resembled the soldiers that patrolled this large city. The other students stared at [[Oliviero]], not aggressively, but like he was oddity. Finally [[Oliviero]] reached the room of Professor Vlodt, the man who [[Oliviero]]'s old professor told him to contact. They discussed history and magic. While not hateful, [Oliviero could sense some of Vlodt's prejudices against Mers and [Mildabia]]n. Still he was impressed by his magical knowledge and got a better understanding of the Pevolian school of thoughts around magic. Pevolian's believes that someone named Ishtarr (goddess or not) taught the people magic. Vlodt also explained that magic works by using runes and vocal commands to access the source of magic. The runic characters and vocals allow magic to be channeled in a certain way. Alchemy uses chemical reactions to do a similar effect, while faith-magic relies on the deity performing the magical invocation. Vlodt gave [[Oliviero]] a tour. [[Oliviero]] met Heinrech the portal professor, and [[Oliviero]] got the feel that the students at the university weren't really interested in learning about magic as much as he was. However, he was impressed by the portal profs knowledge. </p> <p>After the tour, [[Oliviero]] headed back to the inn, his mind was not made up. Would he stay or would he go back home? On his way out he was stopped by a student of the college who attacked him for seemingly know reason. [[Oliviero]] expertly just blinked out of the way and kept walking. And when he got back to the inn he had some delicious food and a nice bath. </p> <p>Oren was invited to dinner at Vidalia's sister's apartment. He eagerly accepted. Vidalia picked him up and they walked together to the apartment. Vidalia asked [[Oren]] what it was like working for [[Lorenzo]]. [[Oren]] gave a wry response. [[Oren]] asked her if she might move to the capitol. Vidalia replied that she did not like the dirt streets and was excited to get back to the solid stone ground of the mountain-home. They had a lovely dinner at Pearl's (Vidalia's sister) apartment. The dinner reminded [[Oren]] of his childhood and his brothers. They grew up together on the mountainside of Lobreux, alongside Pearl and Vidalia. It was nostalgic. Obviously his mind drifted to Althorn, to his first hunt, and to his mysterious dream. The conversations was nice. They played a traditional Lobrexian tile game. While this was going on, a drunkard knocked on the door and wouldn't leave for a long time. Pearl explained to Vidalia and [[Oren]] that this was someone who lived on her floor. He was a soldier in the army, who would always come looking for booze and trying to break in. It soured the mood for a time, but things got back to normal. When the visit was over, Vidalia wanted to walk [[Oren]] back to the Inn, but Pearl explained that the area wasn't great and that she shouldn't be out alone at night. [[Oren]] said his goodbyes and closed the door behind him. He beelined to the drunkard's apartment, following the stench of Pevolian Ale. [[Oren]] knocked on the door and shoved the drunkard to the ground. The drunkard was in a stupor, barely comprehensible. [[Oren]] drew Pearl's apartment number and then an x to it on the wall of the drunkards apartment. [[Oren]] was intimidating as he told the drunk to leave Pearl alone. [[Oren]] walked home, satisfied.</p> <p>[[Tomakin]] went to lunch with Harim, the half-thiim priest who had helped them slay the elemental. Harim talked to [[Tomakin]] about his past. [[Tomakin]] told him about his father, and the story of what happened to his mother. Harim comforted him, expressing that the priests no longer feel this way: case in point Harim himself, a half-thiim priest. Harim asked [[Tomakin]] if he had ever thought of becoming someone who used faith-based magic. [[Tomakin]] thought this was funny. He was not the type. Towards the end of their lunch, Harim explained to [[Tomakin]] that he had found a way to break the seal that held in [[Tomakin]]'s wings. Harim cautioned [[Tomakin]] that there was no going back from this. [[Tomakin]] gladly accepted the offer. The seal was broken and now [[Tomakin]] had navy blue beautiful wings. Harim and [[Tomakin]], now friends, part ways. On the way home everyone stared at him, but [[Tomakin]] finally felt like himself. His father had tried to protect him from his destiny. [[Tomakin]] was now finally who he always was: a half-thiim, a strong, winged half-thiim with the blood of his father, a powerful Aglthiim, coursing through his veins. His mind raced and his heart soared wondering how he was going to use these wings.</p> <p>So [[Lorenzo]] with [[Tomakin]], [[Skee]], and [[Oren]] went to deliver the spice to the general. They approached the imposing walls of the capitol's military complex. There the party sans [Oliviero is greeted by General Mikal Kutzov and his assistant/translator. The translator and General Kutzov gave the party a brief tour and explained to the party why the military needed the sweet-leaf. Through a controlled demonstration, the general showed that mixing the spice with g2 accelerant, it caused an explosion of sleeping gas (that in large quantities could be lethal).</p> <p>Why did the Pevolian military need this gas? The general's translator explained that the Pevolians were going to war with the [Mildabia]]ns and the Olorodnians, as well as pretty much every other power on the eastern continent. This gas would allow the military to be able to quickly conquer and capture large civilian populations. This didn't sit well with [[Lorenzo]], though he kept his composure. When the party got back to the hotel, [[Lorenzo]] revealed his plan: the party was going to steal the spices back. Everyone was on board. And [[Tomakin]] even suggested that perhaps they could get Harim and Olgo the Priest of Ishtarr. The plan for the great spice heist was made!</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-2/#arc-2-episode-7","title":"Arc 2 Episode 7 :","text":"<p>The party got the team together. Harim got on board with the plan for the spice heist. Olgo York decided to come along too. [[Skee]] was left at the hotel, since this was a dangerous mission. There was a brief reunion with Dayson who was in the city and fed the party some information about the back entrance to the capitol military complex (headquarters of the OTSIBYA (military branch of Pevolian government)). The party waited until the next night to try and sneak into the base. They were successful, except Olgo chickened out and went home. The party through [[Oliviero]]'s blinking and [[Tomakin]]'s flight made quick work of individual guards as they worked through the building. Meanwhile [Oren faked being a pest inspector and was able to get a lot of guards away from the prison area of the base. There the party found Jon (one of Giocar's men), his crew, and also some [Mildabia]]n political prisoners. Jon explained that after he had delivered his portion of the spice, that the government arrested him and his men. They one by one were experimented on with military-grade magical and chemical weapons. [[Lorenzo]] and co. set the prisoners free. The party continued moving through the base. Taking out guards and looking for the spice. Then they saw a door which seemed to lead to a laboratory. They looked inside and saw the spices.</p> <p>[[Lorenzo]] and the party + Harim and Jon all waited outside the door. [[Oliviero]] could hear familiar voices on the other side. It was Prof. Vlodt and Heinrech! They along with two other workers toiled with the sweet leaf. They all wore masks that obstructed their faces. Jon kicked down the door and [[Oren]] fired an arrow. Combat had started. [[Tomakin]] flew into battle. One of the mages vanished. Another, Vlodt, attempt to launch a spell but [[Oliviero]] countered it. [[Oliviero]] used gust rune to counterattack, hurling bottles of g2 accelerant and Vlodt into the wall, burning him to ash in an explosion. Meanwhile Heinrech through portals around the room, but none of them hit their target. [[Tomakin]] clashed dagger and hook against the biggest of the mages. This one had a single glowing eye of the forsaken. Meanwhile [[Oren]] was suddenly surrounded by clones of himself that were all attacking him. Jon rushed in to help [[Tomakin]]. Jon hit a clone on his run into the fray yelling \"I always wanted to do that.\" Harim followed after Jon, trading blows with the fake [[Oren]] clones.</p> <p>Heinrech launched a magical attack that knocked both [[Oliviero]] and [[Tomakin]] down. Jon slapped the strong mage pretty hard with his staff. The fight raged on. Heinrech was knocked unconscious by [[Chris]]. Then Heinrech's head was smashed in by Jon's bowstaff. Suddenly the mage who had disappeared, reappeared. She let out a magical wail that pierced everyone in the entire room. A scream so powerful and full of despair. \"BELTUGESE NO.\" This dealt massive damage to the party. And [[Tomakin]] was left there lying on the ground. His ears began to bleed, along with all the other injuries he had sustained in the battle. The party was able to deal with the last mage, but they were not able to help [[Tomakin]]. They had no healers with them who knew strong enough magic. Harim tried his hardest to stabilize [[Tomakin]], but it was no use. As [[Tomakin]] began to fade from this world, he saw his father who delivered a message. \"The High Aglthiim had heard the cries of [[Tomakin]] and Harim. They knew about all that the Pevolian military had planned.\" Retribution was coming.</p> <p>The party was able to steal some of the spice, and set fire to the rest of it. The commotion from the fight had gotten the attention of the guards. With some of the last ounces of magic [[Oliviero]] was able to use, he teleport the crew + Jon and Harim and a dying [[Tomakin]].

The party managed to escape the walls except for [[Lorenzo]] who was caught by the guards. Just when they were about to attack him, a shining blue light shot down from the sky and hit them. It was [[Tomakin]]'s father, Terishiel. Terishiel easily handled the guards, but still walked away with a minor injury. [Oren noticed this and had a realization. The Aglthiim weren't gods. They were mortal and could die. Terishiel wept over the loss of his son. When this was done, he explained to the party that they needed to get everyone they love and evacuate the city. The Aglthiim were coming to destroy the city. This was to punish the Pevolians for even thinking of harming the [Mildabia]]ns. The party with the aid of Terishiel were able to get everyone they love and make it to Jon's boat which was still docked at port. This included Vidalia, Pearl, [[Leona]], and [[Skee]]. They all sailed away just in time. Makaria-Basillisedes most supreme of the Aglthiim descended from the sky in a cloud of thunder. He gave his proclamation. Soon dozens of Aglthiim streamed down from the sky. Burning the city and killing inhabitants, specifically those in the wealthy and military districts. [[Oren]] averted his eyes. He could not witness such destruction. Terishiel the Aglthiim agreed with him. This was an act of unparalleled aggression. This was an attack on people who didn't even know that a war was coming.

To some they were benevolent creators, but to [[Eblis]] and those who sided with him they were dictators who were apathetic to their own creation. [[Oliviero]] innate quest for knowledge, not to mention independence from his stuffy politician parents, led him to side more and more with [[Eblis]] over the loops.</p> <p>Eventually [[Oliviero]] revealed to the party the location of where [[Eblis]]'s followers were summoning the wave elemental out in the ocean. After a few loops of trying to convince [[Giocar]] to join them, they were finally successful when [[Jhun]] convinced [[Giocar]] that he was his (adopted) son from the future who had come back in time to stop an event that would leave [[Giocar]] armless and mauled. With the combined forces of [[Giocar]] and the Pierros, they took the fight directly to the elemental. However after [[Eblis]] dropped a meteor on the ship, the crew was doomed. [[Oliviero]] returned to [[Eblis]] to bargain. [[Oliviero]] would work with [[Eblis]] as a double agent, if he let his friends live today. After getting to know [[Oliviero]] over many iterations, [[Eblis]] accepted. In the final loop [[Eblis]] was \"defeated\" and [[Oren]] was able to save his brother who was trapped in the maw of the elemental. [[Giocar]] killed his old bounty hunter [[Mako]], saving himself from what he thought would be an armless fate. It was a great success to the party, even if the victory was a bit hollow behind the scenes.</p> <p>[[Steven]] congratulates the team for a job well done and does a finally reset, wiping the parties memories and giving them various gifts and opportunities. [[Jhun]], a [[Giocar]] fan boy, was put on his ship with [[Giocar]] thinking he was his adopted son. [[Lorenzo]] continued to live his life as the shrewdest trader on the seas (who was now engaged!). [[Oren]] and his rescued brother were teleported back to Lobreux and reunited with their families. It was then just [[Oliviero]] and [[Steven]] floating in the void. [[Steven]] explained to [[Oliviero]] that he knew about the backdoor deal with [[Eblis]]. Displaying a fraction of his power, [[Steven]] coerced [[Oliviero]] to work as a triple agent, to take down [[Eblis]]. As this happened [[Oliviero]] formulated a plan. His next mission? From [[Eblis]], recover an artifact and bring it to [[Eblis]]. From [[Steven]], slay [[Eblis]] with that artifact.

The only ones that could be missing from the main crew were Orenand Skee but perhaps Jinn had stolen from other ships. Since Pops and Denesi were out on parental leave after the birth of their daughter, Tomazia, Lorenzo needed a new first mate. He went with Brutus. Brutus brought along with him some members of his own ship, the Lioneer, along for the journey. This included Kordial, Malvista, and Brutus's first mate Leon, and accomplished strategist and sword-wielder. Also aboard was the deckhand, Marta, who was allegedly [Skee's]] girlfriend. Rounding out our new crew was [[Ghost]] an assassin and scout hired by [Lorenzo on behest of his Uncle Scachi. The sailing from [Sidio Barca]] was smooth sailing. They sailed to frozen north of the ocean, so cold they could see their breath.</p> <p>[[Chris]] was sent out to scout for the [[Jinn]] ship and sure enough there it was, exactly where the letter said it would be. After much deliberation [[Lorenzo]] went aboard to meet with the Jinn. [[Ghost]] used her magic to follow [[Lorenzo]], but this secret is not yet known by the crew. </p> <p>[Jinn explains who he is \"A god from a long lost world, wrestler of the god Eskil, bane of Aglthiim, terror of [Pevolia]]. I am part god, looking to restore myself to full power get off this god-forsaken planet.\u201d [[Jinn]] then explained how his essence was scatter amongst other beings who looked to claim his power for his own. [[Lorenzo]] did not make much sense of this (I can not blame him this is very complicated). </p> <p>Anyway, [[Jinn]] then explained why he wanted to use [[Lorenzo]]. [[Jinn]] explained, \"A spy on [[Giocar]]\u2019s ship has heard that [[Giocar]] is searching for a blade that can kill gods. [[Giocar]] has discovered that the crew's old passenger, the mage, [Oliviero, is on a rendezvous with the blade.\" Jinn wants the blade in northern [Rocevelen]] and since Lorenzo's crew has a relationship with [[Oliviero]] thinks that  [[Lorenzo]] will be able to convince or trick Oliviero into giving it to them.</p> <p>As a show of good faith, [[Jinn]] releases [[Oren]], esteemed member of Lorenzo's crew. [[Oren]] is not picked without reason, for as long as Oren's brothers are prisoners of the [[Jinn]], [[Jinn]] knows that [[Oren]] will work hard to ensure their freedom. And [[Jinn]] knows that [[Oren]] is quite a fighter as well. No one else had made it that far into The Pit and survived. Only [[Jericho]] had ever managed to escape it. [[Oren]] objected to being set free before [[Skee]] and his brothers, but Jinn ignored his pleas.</p> <p>[[Lorenzo]], not knowing what else to do, accepted the deal. After a brief drinking competition with [[Jinn]],  [[Lorenzo]] took [[Oren]] back to the Teknesi. There was not much hope in the short term, but in the long-term [[Oren]] had a way out, a way to free his brothers and his friends who had made the dangerous voyage with him. But that path also was dangerous for the world: [[Jinn]] the Conqueror, the most awful foe [[Oren]] had ever faced, wielding a weapon of immeasurable power.</p> <p>When [[Lorenzo]] got back to the ship there was conversation among [[Brutus]], [[Oren]], [[Leon]], and Captain [[Lorenzo]]. [[Jinn]], they felt at the time, was too powerful to take on now. [[Lorenzo]] was unsure how [[Oliviero]] would handle seeing him again. While [[Lorenzo]] did not know how close [[Oliviero]] had gotten to [Eblis, he knew enough to know that [the Abyss of the Ageless]] was not something to play with and that information came from [[Pops]] himself. [[Leon]]'s curiosity was peaked when hearing about such dark forces, but he was fearful. [Ghost meanwhile kept to herself, interjecting with her morbid sense of humor when she could. </p> <p>In the end, the crew set sail for [Rocevelen]] where they suspected [[Oliviero]] would head. They were unsure yet as to what the plan was going to be: ask for Oliviero to give them the sword, take it from him, or ask him to help them kill [[Jinn]]. That was not yet to be decided. They passed the glaciers as the night turned cold and they went below deck to sleep.</p> <p>[[Leon]] was caught in his reoccurring nightmare. He had been having it since he picked up a sword in his past. A battlefield, foes twice his size, blood and mud, stone and steel. He followed something far ahead. A grey robe, it's owner a skull with glowing, no flaming blue eyes and flowing brown hair. It beckoned him forward on the battlefield, as [[Leon]] clashed with foes twice his size. The skull called [[Leon]] \"Seed of Gamesh\" and told [Leon that he was someone who aided Leon's ancestor Gamesh during times of war. But what had peaked this flaming figure's interest today was hearing of the [Abyss of the Ageless]] and [[Eblis]], whom sounded like they wielded magic long-thought to be forgotten. [[Leon]] was tasked by the skull to learn more about these dark figures. Then he awoke from the never-ending battlefield in a cold sweat. Then he went out onto the deck to get a breath of fresh air.

That was one member of crew spotted a squid, one that could feed the entire crew for a week.</p> <p>[Ghost, tired of stale bread and fish yogurt, cast her icey-[ageless]] powers and used her ghost form to decimate the squid. She was not as stealthy as she should have been however, and [[Oren]] noticed her ability and surmised its likely origin. The squid, on its last leg, grabbed [[Leon]] and attempted to drag him into the ocean. Just as [[Leon]] metal armor was going to drag him to the icey depths, [[Ghost]] used her ghost form to drag [[Leon]] out of the water. The party was confused how [[Leon]] floated out of the water, all except [[Oren]]. [[Leon]] attempted to flirt with [[Leona]], but was promptly rebuffed much to [[Lorenzo]]'s delight.

The ship grazed against the side of the iceberg, but they were safe.</p> <p>At the moment of impact, [Ghost was whisked away from her ghostly projection back to her own body. A green portal, glowing green just like her eyes was in front of her. Years ago she had made a pact with the [Ageless]]. This was a promise that she hadn't kept, instead using their power for her own gain, becoming one if not the best bounty-hunter in Melia Mar. She felt like she had no choice and walked through the portal. On the other side was [[Lupine]], one of [[Eblis]] allies. [[Lupine]] had been watching [[Ghost]] and offered her a lucrative deal.

The ship had suffered serious damage, and was in need of repairs. They also needed to turn over the captured pirates to the proper authorities. [Leona suggested making a pitstop in [Cuma Cura]] to which [[Lorenzo]] and [[Brutus]] agreed.</p> <p>The party arrived on the spice island, it was small but had a dockyard where the ship could be repaired, and dino-like birds that were much smaller than [[Chris]]. The gang headed to a lovely inn-bar hybrid. The bartender was happy to provide info about the dockyard, however he was wary about offering information on turning in the pirates. The barkeep, Jimmy Santina, explained that there were some rather intimidating pirates who had arrived yesterday and were held up in the back of the bar. The party looked back, and who did they see? [[Giocar]], [[Jhun]], [[Mondo]] the Fishman, a rather well-dressed mage named Ronaldo, as well as a few more men whom they recognized from Giocar's ship, the Grand Reale. [[Giocar]] and [[Lorenzo]] had a friendly reunion. Giocar explained that (as the [[Jinn]] spy had reported) he was after a sword that could slay gods. [[Giocar]] was not after it to kill a god, no. He wanted to make a deal with gods, a trade. Ideally he wanted to gain immortality for both him and his adopted son, [[Jhun]]. There was some tension in the room when [[Lorenzo]] admitted that they to were seeking [[Oliviero]] and the sword that they were all after. [[Oren]] and [[Mondo]]'s friendship allowed for cooler heads to prevail. Especially as [[Leon]] caught [[Giocar]]'s eye. Giocar hoped that this would not harm his business relationships, attacking the Jinn, but he stated \"If I am immortal, then business is booming.\" There was at least a temporary alliance.</p> <p>The trick that Giocar had for tracking [[Oliviero]] and [[Eblis]] was quite smart. His mage, Ronaldo, had captured a possessed foot soldier. Using magic Ronaldo was able to reverse-engineer the lens that the Tyrant's used to see what their followers saw (this is why the Forsakens' eyes glow).

This time however, him and his brother's consciousness in sleep drifted into each other. In other words, they were able to completely communicate. Althorn explained two things to Oren. One, that the [[Jinn]] ship was following the Teknesi. And two, that the situation for the prisoners aboard the Jinn ship had gotten dire. [[Skee]] had attempted a daring escape, but its failure had led to more cruelty from their captors.</p> <p>Althorn and Oren agreed that they did not want the relic to fall into the wrong hands. Oren explained to Althorn that they were now sailing with Giocar's ship. Maybe Giocar would be willing to help free the prisoners aboard the Jinn ship since defeating Jinn would mean there would be one less powerful entity after the sword.</p> <p>The next morning, Oren went to [[Lorenzo]] and explained his dream. Lorenzo knew that Oren was not crazy, but also did not know if Giocar would like attacking Jinn head-on. Lorenzo and Giocar had a little meeting before Giocar went back and consulted his skeleton-crew. [Mondo was eager to help Oren save his friends and family, as Oren had once saved his life, see here. Jon likewise had had his life saved by Oren, [see here]], and though he did not like Oren felt like he owed him. </p> <p>Giocar decided that he would help the Teknesi crew save the prisoners and take out [[Jinn]].

The air crackled, a flash of white light turning to crimson, then fading back to darkness and smoke. The red lightning strike carved a large whole through the deck of the Jinn ship. It also scarred Jinn across his chest as he was knocked out of his chair screaming in pain. He was looking around, but unable to find who had struck him with such power. The ice-elemental, attracted to the strike of Ghost soon began attacking the Jinn ship and the whole ship started to take on water.</p> <p>But [[Jinn]] got up. He saw the crew of the Teknesi begin to board his ship.  He was not going to go down, not like this. He was a god who had lived and fought for millennia.

He, a follower of [[Lupine]] was much more into brute force. Gaelan did not care to learn the details of the mission and was more so focused on helping his new compatriots head north and with a low profile.

Raxus told the local that he had his taxes outside. The party was a bit confused but played along. Raxus and the local went outside and as soon as the door swung shut, Raxus murdered the local in cold-blood. The screams meant that the soldiers who were in the inn came to the door and when Raxus reentered it was rather obvious what he had done. The guards surrounded Raxus, but by his intimidating presence, the soldiers did not immediately attack. Oliviero knew that the party had to flee the inn immediately.

There they were confronted by guards who claimed that monsters had been attacking livestock and townsfolk. The party was honest and said they knew nothing of it. The guards still requested that the party stay in lockdown over night to ensure that they (specifically the beastly looking Raxus) were not the culprits. The party rebuffed this however an unwitting Raxus revealed his claws, prompting the guards to rush to the Mayor's office. </p> <p>Oliviero and Raxus got into an argument where in which they threatened each other, but Raxus admitting some fault was his for the past 12 hours. At the very least now, they had a town's attention, but maybe at least the shops and the blacksmiths would be kind to them.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-4/#episode-8","title":"Episode 8","text":"<p>The party began exploring the town. They found some pretty fresh bloodstains in a ravine, pointed out thanks to their cow. The guards once again reminded the party that they were requested to quarantine, much to [[Oliviero]] and [[Raxus]]'s displeasure. The party continued their venture into town and discovered many shops. The price of weapons and beef had grown expensive, do to the monster attacks. Oliviero had a conversation with a particular fellow who was set on hunting the monster, which Oliviero found foolhardy. Meanwhile Raxus got new armor after trading in [[Chef]]'s armor that he had stolen. The blacksmith was impressed that he had acquired so many compass balls. The blacksmith explained that they all pointed to different individuals via magic.</p> <p>Meanwhile, [[The Red Herald]] went to an apothecary and charmed his way into some sweet leaf before learning more about the gruesome ends that the monster left his victims to. The Red Herald then insulted the woman and went on his way. At this time, [Gaelan stocked up the party on some peanuts and vegetarian supply options.</p> <p>The guards returned and the captain of the guard took the party to the mayor's office. The mayor was Jimony Kell. A rather uncouth fellow, a short stammerer. He told the party that just for one night that the party would be quarantined just in case this was some sort of werewolf kind of thing. The mayor asked Raxus if he had met him before, but Raxus had no recollection. The party begrudgingly agreed and was put up in a safe house just outside of the mayor's office.</p> <p>The party was set inside with a guard posted outside. There were a few more inside each with a guard posted outside. The Red Herald hung his bed sheets around his room and meditated. His eyes began glowing a fierce blue, much brighter than normal. He went into the space known as the In-between. There he visited Amarus, the Tyrant known as The Hand. The Red Herald and Amarus has what I will call a \"special relationship\". After some saucy dialogue, Amarus emphasized her hatred for [The Creators]] and [[Steven]]. Just as things were about to get even saucier, Oliviero blinked into the In-between to see what was going on in there. He made fun of Amarus for her relationship with The Red Herald. Amarus expressed in plain terms that she did not trust or like Oliviero and said that she thought [[Eblis]] was wrong to place so much trust in Oliviero. Oliviero, regretting seeing whatever was going on between man and goat-woman blinked back into existence. </p> <p>Meanwhile Raxus was pulling pranks on The Red Herald's meditative body. He then shared a moment with Gaelan where he tried peanuts for the first time. Oliviero meanwhile, peered out the window into the dark streets and saw a man walking down them with a sack. It was far past curfew at this point, so this peeked Oliviero's curiosity. He watched the man drag a big sack into the mayor's office. Oliviero blinked out to investigate, and the rest of the party soon opened the window and followed suit. They were able to sneak inside the mayor's office and found a secret staircase. Down there, they discovered a horrible secret. The mayor, Jimony Kell, was working on creating a terrible monster that he called \"his chimera\". It was a fearsome monstrosity constructed out of the parts of a bunch of different parts from a bunch of different animals.  J. Kell had been working on this for month, feeding it whatever he could find in the village. He revealed all this to the party when they found him down in the basement. He also told them how he had met Raxus's creator, Dr. Truenstein.</p> <p>(Raxus's backstory is that from a young age he was taken in by an evil scientist who performed horrible experiments on him for years. He was trying to create the ultimate weapon for reasons that are unknown. One day, the Tyrant [[Lupine]] offered Raxus power so that he could escape the mad doctor. Raxus using his new found power murdered the scientist and escaped the lab)</p> <p>J. Kell released the monster and the team was once again on their backfoot. The chimera lunged with ferocious speed at The Red Herald, nearly breaking his magic shield.  The Herald was sure in his strategy though and used a rune that he had placed on the wall to send a gust that blew the chimera into the opposite wall. Oliviero quite sure of himself approached the chimera and swiftly placed a sealing rune on it's back. Meanwhile Raxus pummeled a roided up Jimony Kell into submission. They pushed the chimera back into its cage. But the party still had to decide what it would do with the evil scientist Mayor Jimony Kell...</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-4/#episode-9","title":"Episode 9","text":"<p>The party sans [[Gaelan]] debated over what to do with the evil mayor and the beast. [[Raxus]] offered the beast to [[Lupine]], and Lupine possessed the beast and now had control of the chimera. What to do with the mayor took a bit more of a debate. [[Oliviero]] and [[Raxus]] debated just killing the mad scientist, but while they were busy talking [[The Red Herald]] blew up Jimony's head with a Black Orb.</p> <p>After this murder, the party were confronted by the guards of the town, and again [[Oliviero]] got out of it by mindwiping people. [Steven was alarmed by the flippant use of murk magic but tried to appear calm as he was in a meeting with his bosses who were fellow [creators]]. </p> <p>The party headed back on the road and [[Oliviero]] bought some magical items. [[Gaelan]] revealed more of him and his cow's backstory. They were just lonely wanderers looking for friends. [[Eblis]] took advantage of this. Eblis and Oliviero had a meeting in the In-between where in which Eblis told Oliviero that they would rendevous in the nearby town of Lerndel. Eblis had possessed the body of a blind Mer who was a necromancer and used those abilities to resurrect [Mako, who had already undergone the ritual of becoming a [tyrant]]-hybrid. Eblis was disappointed as once again Oliviero rebuffed his offer of power in exchange for possession. </p> <p>After this Oliviero was visited by [Lucien who told him that other gods from across the universe had learned of the sword and were seeking it out. Lucien explained that the [Aglthiim]] council had been corrupted by outside forces and that he was seeking the sword to defeat them. They were the ones who had ordered him to kill Ulacham, which he did not want to did, but did so fearing for his life. Oliviero listened but did not give his word, and Lucien let him be.</p> <p>The party continued down the road as [[Raxus]] further ate into the peanut supply. As the party made camp, friends of [[Chef]] descended on them. They were tracking the compass that they had pilfered from Chef. After intense questioning[[Oliviero]] was able to get them to calm down thanks to him having sailed with [[Pops]],  a mutual friend of [[Chef]]'s. The party went to be knowing they had dodged a bullet.</p>"},{"location":"Melia-Recaps-4/#episode-10","title":"Episode 10","text":"<p>The party quickly approached Lerndel by foot. They briefly met some tourists along the way who expressed their love of Lerndel, its cafes and spire. As the party traveled over a nearby hill, they too could see the stone spire stick out from the ground, like a tower looking over the city. They had arrived in Lerndel, the last stop before their final destination in Bristok.</p> <p>The party quickly drew suspicion to themselves thanks to [[Oliviero]] blinking into the In-between. Meanwhile [[Raxus]] and [[The Red Herald]] went to the local fish-market to stock up on meats. While Oliviero was in the In-between, [[Eblis]]'s presence was not. Oliviero waited for awhile and finally a quick message came from Eblis. They were being watched and that Oliviero had to hurry to the spire in town so they could meet up. When Oliviero blinked back into existence, he was greeted by a troubled [[Gaelan]]. Gaelan explained that his cow was locked in a staring contest with the other cows in the town and appeared to be in distress. With much effort, Oliviero was able to drag the cow into the In-between, breaking whatever weird deathstare was going on there. So much teleporting, got the attention of the town guards who warned Oliviero not to teleport so much. </p> <p>Meanwhile Raxus and The Red Herald haggled for fish with some bickering between them. The Red Herald was able to procure a better price and then slapped Raxus with a fish, which lead Raxus to smash The Red Herald's mug of brew. The Red Herald, still thirsty, went to one of the local cafes he had heard about from the tourists. Meanwhile Raxus continued exploring Lerndel.</p> <p>At this time, Oliviero and Gaelan met Eblis's blind-fishman avatar and [[Mako]], or well a skeleton-version of Mako who had been resurrected from the dead. There was a quick greeting. Then Eblis through possessing the fishman explained to Oliviero the situation someone, some mage, had found a way to reverse the eyes of the forsaken and peer back into the In-between, where Eblis's spirit resided and where he and Oliviero communicated with each other. This was bad and from now on they could not contact each other in this way. This was not a big deal however, as Eblis was able to possess the blind fishman's body and talk with him directly. Eblis was excited to finish their quest, but first wanted to stop at a cafe; it had been awhile since he had food. In this cafe, they would reunite with The Red Herald.</p> <p>Mako and Raxus, who had already sized each other up, decided to neglect the cafe trip. Instead the explored the city and investigated the spire. Mako, wearing a large cloak to obscure his skeletal form admired the spire from a distance. Raxus on the other hand decided to climb it. Mako watched astonished as Raxus scaled the stone using his claws. While this was going on Mako was approached by a lady in haggardly green robes. She looked young in the face, but her eyes look much older. She tried to strike up a conversation with Mako. She made up a story about being poor and needing to get to the next town. She casually stated that she and her brother had made spires like the one Mako was admiring which perplexed him. Then the lady in green went to touch Mako's face which made him take a step back and get defensive.</p> <p>\"Ah sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I am not used to dealing with lower life forms.\"</p> <p>And with a wave of her hand, Mako forgot everything about the conversation they had just had. It was like it had never happened. Instead the lady in green reintroduced herself to Mako. She was polite and didn't come on so strong this time. She even got Mako to agree to let her travel with the party!</p> <p>Meanwhile Raxus scaled the tower and was met by a watchman and his hawk. The guard explained that Raxus was not allowed up on top of the spire, which truthfully Raxus had not realized. Raxus was able to talk the guard down and make his way back down. Mako introduced the lady in green to Raxus, and then the three of them noticed that a crowd was forming outside the cafe.</p> <p>The Red Herald's eyes, the eyes that all forsaken bare had attracted the attention of the local priests. They knew that their was something dark and twisted going on with them, and they knew that it should not be allowed in their town. Couple that with Oliviero's flagrant use of magic and also the spookiness of blind Mer, Mako, and Raxus; it was enough to make the priest call the guards and try to jail the party.  Oliviero was immediately targeted as the mage who was able to use teleportation magic on a whim. After two successful dodges, he was finally tackled and cut off from the flow of magic. Meanwhile the blind Mer gripped The Red Herald's shoulder in fear.</p> <p>However the party was going to get out of this mess, it was not going to be pretty. </p> <p>AUTHOR'S NOTES - Two Comments: 1) We know it is [Giocar's mage, Ronaldo, who has found a way to peer into the In=between.  2) The lady in green introduced this week is an [Ador]], specifically the sister of [[Eskil]].
