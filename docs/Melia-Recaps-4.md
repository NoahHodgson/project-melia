## Arc 4 Prologue:
In the beautiful Marble Villas of Sidio Barca, with its lavish apple orchards dotting the landscape, [[Lorenzo]] and his bride, [[Leona]] of Pevolia, prepared for their wedding. It’s evening and the villa looks lovely. Chris flapped his wings in high alert. A dark ominous figure flew overhead. It was a giant bat and it was covered in tattoos. It dropped a note while circling overhead. The note read “If you ever want to see your crew alive again, you will travel 30 knots northeast of Kambradia Island. Do not delay.” -[[Jinn]]

[[Oliviero]] was once again in the void. He had come to know Eblis, but not yet what his plan was for taking down Steven and the rest of the gods. Eblis was more powerful than he could even fathom. But he too had learned a lot over the past two months. Eblis had taught him magic that had been known only in the world before. The world the gods had destroyed. Eblis had also continued tempting [[Oliviero]] with the forsaken power of the tempted, even giving him a taste. But [[Oliviero]] was determined not to lean on Eblis, but use his own power to acquire the sacred relic. After going over the plan one last time Eblis smiled a gruesome smile. “And [[Oliviero]], hurry up, we have time to kill.”

It wasn’t the rocking of the ship that woke [[Oren]] up, no, he was used to that. Nor was it his wounds. The dull aches only lulled him more into sleep. And he had gotten used to that too anyway. It was the chill air. The captain never sailed this far north, at least not on any of the voyages since he’d joined the crew. It jolted [[Oren]] awake. He struggled a bit but saw his hands tied in layers and layers of rags. He remembered everything. 

His return home to Lobreux. The bittersweet reunion with his eldest brother, who had become blinded. His attempt to rescue his youngest brother from the [[Jinn]]. And his failure.`

He frantically looked around the dark ship. It must have been the middle of the night. Whatever ship he was on, it must have been headed north. Then [[Oren]] realized that he was not the only one tied up below deck on the ship. To his right he saw [[Skee]] and Blanca (Vidalia’s Sister), and to his left he saw Portus the Alchemist, who was snoring quite loudly. And across on the other side of the ship were his brothers, Althorn and Edwin, also tied up. [[Oren]] didn’t know whether to be thankful or terrified. The [[Jinn]] had taken them captive, but wherever they were going, they were all going together.
