## Arc 4 Prologue:
In the beautiful Marble Villas of Sidio Barca, with its lavish apple orchards dotting the landscape, [[Lorenzo]] and his bride, [[Leona]] of Pevolia, prepared for their wedding. It’s evening and the villa looks lovely. Chris flapped his wings in high alert. A dark ominous figure flew overhead. It was a giant bat and it was covered in tattoos. It dropped a note while circling overhead. The note read “If you ever want to see your crew alive again, you will travel 30 knots northeast of Kambradia Island. Do not delay.” -[[Jinn]]

[[Oliviero]] was once again in the void. He had come to know Eblis, but not yet what his plan was for taking down Steven and the rest of the gods. Eblis was more powerful than he could even fathom. But he too had learned a lot over the past two months. Eblis had taught him magic that had been known only in the world before. The world the gods had destroyed. Eblis had also continued tempting [[Oliviero]] with the forsaken power of the tempted, even giving him a taste. But [[Oliviero]] was determined not to lean on Eblis, but use his own power to acquire the sacred relic. After going over the plan one last time Eblis smiled a gruesome smile. “And [[Oliviero]], hurry up, we have time to kill.”

It wasn’t the rocking of the ship that woke [[Oren]] up, no, he was used to that. Nor was it his wounds. The dull aches only lulled him more into sleep. And he had gotten used to that too anyway. It was the chill air. The captain never sailed this far north, at least not on any of the voyages since he’d joined the crew. It jolted [[Oren]] awake. He struggled a bit but saw his hands tied in layers and layers of rags. He remembered everything. 

His return home to Lobreux. The bittersweet reunion with his eldest brother, who had become blinded. His attempt to rescue his youngest brother from the [[Jinn]]. And his failure.`

He frantically looked around the dark ship. It must have been the middle of the night. Whatever ship he was on, it must have been headed north. Then [[Oren]] realized that he was not the only one tied up below deck on the ship. To his right he saw [[Skee]] and Blanca (Vidalia’s Sister), and to his left he saw Portus the Alchemist, who was snoring quite loudly. And across on the other side of the ship were his brothers, Althorn and Edwin, also tied up. [[Oren]] didn’t know whether to be thankful or terrified. The [[Jinn]] had taken them captive, but wherever they were going, they were all going together.

## Episode 1
After the wedding [[Lorenzo]] and [[Leona]] set sail on the Teknesi to go investigate what happened to the missing crew members. The only ones that could be missing from the main crew were [[Oren]]and [[Skee]] but perhaps [[Jinn]] had stolen from other ships. Since [[Pops]] and [[Denesi]] were out on parental leave after the birth of their daughter, Tomazia, [[Lorenzo]] needed a new first mate. He went with [[Brutus]]. Brutus brought along with him some members of his own ship, the Lioneer, along for the journey. This included Kordial, Malvista, and Brutus's first mate [[Leon]], and accomplished strategist and sword-wielder. Also aboard was the deckhand, Marta, who was allegedly [[Skee|Skee's]] girlfriend. Rounding out our new crew was [[Ghost]] an assassin and scout hired by [[Lorenzo]] on behest of his Uncle Scachi. The sailing from [[Melia-Mar-Biographics#Barcazona|Sidio Barca]] was smooth sailing. They sailed to frozen north of the ocean, so cold they could see their breath.

[[Chris]] was sent out to scout for the [[Jinn]] ship and sure enough there it was, exactly where the letter said it would be. After much deliberation [[Lorenzo]] went aboard to meet with the Jinn. [[Ghost]] used her magic to follow [[Lorenzo]], but this secret is not yet known by the crew. 

[[Jinn]] explains who he is "A god from a long lost world, wrestler of the god Eskil, bane of Aglthiim, terror of [[Melia-Mar-Biographics#Pevolia|Pevolia]]. I am part god, looking to restore myself to full power get off this god-forsaken planet.” [[Jinn]] then explained how his essence was scatter amongst other beings who looked to claim his power for his own. [[Lorenzo]] did not make much sense of this (I can not blame him this is very complicated). 

Anyway, [[Jinn]] then explained why he wanted to use [[Lorenzo]]. [[Jinn]] explained, "A spy on [[Giocar]]’s ship has heard that [[Giocar]] is searching for a blade that can kill gods. [[Giocar]] has discovered that the crew's old passenger, the mage, [[Oliviero]], is on a rendezvous with the blade." Jinn wants the blade in northern [[Melia-Mar-Biographics#Rocevelen|Rocevelen]] and since Lorenzo's crew has a relationship with [[Oliviero]] thinks that  [[Lorenzo]] will be able to convince or trick Oliviero into giving it to them.

As a show of good faith, [[Jinn]] releases [[Oren]], esteemed member of Lorenzo's crew. [[Oren]] is not picked without reason, for as long as Oren's brothers are prisoners of the [[Jinn]], [[Jinn]] knows that [[Oren]] will work hard to ensure their freedom. And [[Jinn]] knows that [[Oren]] is quite a fighter as well. No one else had made it that far into The Pit and survived. Only [[Jericho]] had ever managed to escape it. [[Oren]] objected to being set free before [[Skee]] and his brothers, but Jinn ignored his pleas.

[[Lorenzo]], not knowing what else to do, accepted the deal. After a brief drinking competition with [[Jinn]],  [[Lorenzo]] took [[Oren]] back to the Teknesi. There was not much hope in the short term, but in the long-term [[Oren]] had a way out, a way to free his brothers and his friends who had made the dangerous voyage with him. But that path also was dangerous for the world: [[Jinn]] the Conqueror, the most awful foe [[Oren]] had ever faced, wielding a weapon of immeasurable power.

When [[Lorenzo]] got back to the ship there was conversation among [[Brutus]], [[Oren]], [[Leon]], and Captain [[Lorenzo]]. [[Jinn]], they felt at the time, was too powerful to take on now. [[Lorenzo]] was unsure how [[Oliviero]] would handle seeing him again. While [[Lorenzo]] did not know how close [[Oliviero]] had gotten to [[Eblis]], he knew enough to know that [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|the Abyss of the Ageless]] was not something to play with and that information came from [[Pops]] himself. [[Leon]]'s curiosity was peaked when hearing about such dark forces, but he was fearful. [[Ghost]] meanwhile kept to herself, interjecting with her morbid sense of humor when she could. 

In the end, the crew set sail for [[Melia-Mar-Biographics#Rocevelen|Rocevelen]] where they suspected [[Oliviero]] would head. They were unsure yet as to what the plan was going to be: ask for Oliviero to give them the sword, take it from him, or ask him to help them kill [[Jinn]]. That was not yet to be decided. They passed the glaciers as the night turned cold and they went below deck to sleep.

[[Leon]] was caught in his reoccurring nightmare. He had been having it since he picked up a sword in his past. A battlefield, foes twice his size, blood and mud, stone and steel. He followed something far ahead. A grey robe, it's owner a skull with glowing, no flaming blue eyes and flowing brown hair. It beckoned him forward on the battlefield, as [[Leon]] clashed with foes twice his size. The skull called [[Leon]] "Seed of Gamesh" and told [[Leon]] that he was someone who aided Leon's ancestor Gamesh during times of [[Melia-Cosmic-History#Era of the Passerbys|war]]. But what had peaked this flaming figure's interest today was hearing of the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|Abyss of the Ageless]] and [[Eblis]], whom sounded like they wielded magic long-thought to be forgotten. [[Leon]] was tasked by the skull to learn more about these dark figures. Then he awoke from the never-ending battlefield in a cold sweat. Then he went out onto the deck to get a breath of fresh air. Cold, fresh air.

## Episode 2
The gang continued to travel at sea. [[Leon]] first, before dawn and soon Oren followed. Oren, true to his nature helped Marta with the chores. A bit later, [[Leona]] introduced [[Oren]] to the rest of the crew. Going on around this time was some one-sided flirting between [[Ghost]] and [[Leon]]. That was one member of crew spotted a squid, one that could feed the entire crew for a week.

[[Ghost]], tired of stale bread and fish yogurt, cast her icey-[[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|ageless]] powers and used her ghost form to decimate the squid. She was not as stealthy as she should have been however, and [[Oren]] noticed her ability and surmised its likely origin. The squid, on its last leg, grabbed [[Leon]] and attempted to drag him into the ocean. Just as [[Leon]] metal armor was going to drag him to the icey depths, [[Ghost]] used her ghost form to drag [[Leon]] out of the water. The party was confused how [[Leon]] floated out of the water, all except [[Oren]]. [[Leon]] attempted to flirt with [[Leona]], but was promptly rebuffed much to [[Lorenzo]]'s delight. [[Ghost]] then tried to flirt with [[Leon]], and he ignored her, so we kind of have a love-triangle (a love square?) going on here.

As the crew continued to sail west to Rocevelen, they past more adrift ice. On one particularly large piece of ice, was a pair of Frost Giants. [[Brutus]] and [[Lorenzo]] thought it was strange to see the giants heading south, but decided since they couldn't communicate, it was better to leave them alone. Not much else happened, that day and the party went to bed with bellies full of squid.

That night, the party was awoken by [[Brutus]]'s blood curdling scream. Apparently the Teknesi had been boarded by some Eskillian pirates. [[Oren]] rushed to the deck, firing arrows into the crowd. [[Ghost]] went ghost form and froze a pirate from the inside out. [[Lorenzo]] and [[Leona]] performed a powerful couples-attack using their ice magic. [[Leon]] meanwhile called upon the god whom had visited him in his dream and wielded a blade of glowing blue fire. He slayed two pirates effortlessly. With many of the pirates dealt with one managed to sneak the captain's wheel and steered the ship. If nothing changes soon, the ship was going to hit one of those adrift icebergs.
The suspense!
