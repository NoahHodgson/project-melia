# Rocevelen
## Roclesia: 
The Roclesian Empire was ruled first by a
	great king, a Alex/JC type guy who conquered it named
	Gamesh. He managed to overwhelm the magically adept
	Tabradians with sheer numbers. They ruled as an empire
	for a long time, before the Tabradian tribes once
	broke free. Recently, a southern portion of the empire
	has also declared independence, and are closely
	aligned to the Sidio Barcans. The empire is starting
	to regain power, however. Roclesia is the most
	advanced country magically, because they stole much
	of the work of the Tabradians. They also are the most
	wealthy.

## Tabradia: 
Grey to actually dark complexions
	with amber eyes with no-pupils. Tabradians
	were once the biggest nation on the Rocevelen
	continent. Then the War of the Magi happened and 
	Gamesh took over the continent. The Tabradians became
	second-class citizens and their magical knowledge
	was stolen by the new overlords. This last a long time
	but eventually Tabradians shrugged off the Roclesians.
	They skirmish with them occasionally, but they 
	remain independent. They are magically adept. 

## Rociaran: 
League of independent Roclesian cities who
	declared themselves separate from the empire. They are
	essentially just the southern traders of Roclesia who 
	took an opportunity to avoid paying taxes to the
	emperor, knowing that the Roclesian overlords were not
	in a position for a full-scale war. That could change
	however as Roclesia regains power.

## Barcazona:
Sidio Barca: Tan skin. Newer civilization that sprung 
	up as they developed sea vessels that could 
	travel across to Rocevelen and Cuma Cura (seas are very
	rough) and more recently even to Berringia. Ruled by
	a Duke with a Senate and significant wealthy families.
	Think Venice mixed with some Turkish elements. 
	
## Cuma Cura: 
Varied people groups. Known by the sb's as
	the Spice Islands. Variety of Flora and fauna not
	seen in the rest of the world. 

# Berringia:

## Eskillia: 
Pale to fair completion, Built an entire
	kingdom centered around using the Stone of Eskil
	to build up the Iron City. When the Stone rejected
	the last prince, the city went into disarray. Since
	the power structure of Eskillia was very centralized
	the kingdom fell into disarray, as it's capitol
	failed. What remains is a host of failed city-states,
	which are plagued by bandits and Pevolian raiders.  

## Pevolia: 
Variety of complexions. Major religion is
	the Pevolian Pantheon, with the Church of Diacci 
	coming in a close second. They conquered the western
	territory within the last 100 years from the two
	princedoms. Pevolia used to be a lesser rival to 
	Eskillia, but after her fall became the regional power
	Pevolia wants to move in and take the Eskillian city
	states by force, but do not due to religious pressure
	from the Church of Diacci. Ruler is called Khassar. 
	They are the most-advanced power on Berringia, and 
	is home to many large cities and magical institutions. 

## Mildabia: 
Mostly darker complexions except Pilgrims
	who come from all over to worship the God's of
	Diacci. Mildabia is divided into districts and cities
	but more so ruled by the Church of Diacci, which
	is not only the majority religion in the country, but
	also all of Berringia. 

## Lobreux: 
Grey to Yellow Complextions. Religion a mix
	of Diacci and local/regional deities. Mining-based.
	Prince is like a Khan, with a large/extended royal
	family. Culture a mix of Pevolian and the two southern
	princedoms. On bad terms with, Olorodnia and Pevolia.
	Economy shifting to be mining based.

## Olorodnia: 
Warm Complextions, follow the church of
	Diacci. Fertile agricultural hub. Prince a kind of
	figure-head. They are generous with their grains
	and are protected by Mildabia and the church. Known
	for being ruled by Arezians idealogues.

## Yubia: 
Grey to Warm Complextion, Ancestor Worshippers 	
	through statues, some follow Diacci. 	
	Ruled by a Prince from one of
	the royal families. Mountanous terrain.
	Economy pretty diverse due to abundant national
	resources.

# Non-contintental:
Mer-Tides: Fangs, fins, but otherwise very humanlike. The Mer
	are an ancient race that precede the other Melians. They
	live in the seas in the south betweeen the continent.
	The larger concentrations exist on atolls farther south in 
	the world.
	
The Frozen North:
	Frost giants roam the icey wastes.

# Religion: 

Rocevelen religion primarily worship the Pantheon
of the All-Father. Basically an Odin-type figure. Local
deities are incorporated into the religion. The All-Father is
somehow the progenitor of all of the other gods. Loki-like
figure called Qali, a trickster.

Tabradi worship Melia, a Gaia-like goddess. Nature-y Druid-y,
but also with some darker elements. Death is also a crucial
character within their customs and plays a crucial role. Last
they believe in Fire as a sentient entity, an evil destroyer
if you will. Tabradian magic that uses fire/explosive magic
is only handled by their most skilled mages, unlike magic 
schools in other cultures where fire spells are scene as 
more amateur. 

Sidio Barcans worship the god of the sea, Deniz. They believe
in other gods and spirits, but Deniz is the only god that
holds any power. They wear necklaces with a five sided
ship-steering wheel, which is said to bring good-luck at sea,
a way for Deniz to identify you.

Eskillians believed that the gods visited them long ago and
gave them the Stone of Eskil. After the fall of Eskillia,
They basically assigned gods to part of the rituals of their
every day life. They also believe in a god of ash, who the
survivors blame for the fall of the kingdom and the plague
currently on their land.

Pevolians do not have a state religion. Some incorporate
Lobrexian deities into some local religions. There's a fair
amount of "magic worshippers" and nonbelievers. There's also
a significant amount of Diaccians within Pevolia, who are
not loyal to the Khassar. 

The Church of Diacci was founded in Mildabia, in what is now
the capitol city. "Agltthim" descended and delivered a message
to a man revealing the "secrets of the universe". There were
witnesses and that man became the first High Priest 
The angels would continue to periodically visit the city and 
the religion gained recognition as the real deal. Agltthim
look like angels with colorful wings and masks that obstruct
their entire face. Since their descent (a few hundred years
ago), the Diacci faith is now practiced Mildabia, Olorodnia,
and all across the continent. 

Lobrexians worship their own pantheon, the primary god
being the Hammerlord Orsan. This god in legend is said to
have built the forges for the Lobreux and taught them the
value of metals.

Yubians primarily  worship their ancestors. Statues containing 
bones of the dead litter the landscapes. Those
 who were considered great get their statues warped into
statues of magical creatures. The Yubians believe that one
day the statues will hatch and the Yubians will be reborn.
There recently also has been a contingent of Diacci believers.

Alchema: Using combinations of elements to create 
	explosions, serums, and various other contraptions.
	"Science Magic".

	strength. Variety of effects obviously. Think Priests 	
	and Warlocks and such. Also char can be a demigod.

Stonoco: Sound/Touch magic left in place by 	
	the architects of the world. Various symbols drawing 	
	and sounds cause magical-chaotic events to happen.
