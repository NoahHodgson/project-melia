Jinn is a crazy dude. He is a god who came to Melia Mar hundreds of years ago. He has no morals; he only wishes to drink, fight, and cause terror. He gained followers and they roaved in a bandit gang throughout Berringia, specifically Pevolia. One day he challenged someone above his weight class and his essence was scattered. He searches to this day with his bandits to reclaim this, kidnapping new recruits along the way.
