Born in a quiet village in [[Melia-Prime-Biographics#Crysos|Crysos]] on the world of Melia Prime, eons before the Melia Mar campaigns, his village was wiped out by the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Kosol|Kosol]]. In the wake of the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Kosol|Kosol]] Incursion, Eblis grew to hate them. With most of the world ravished he experimented on himself and became the first of the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|Tyrants]], also sometimes called Forsaken. After the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Kosol|Kosol]] were finally defeated the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|Tyrants]] ruled the world. The Creators including Steven tried to communicate the [[Melia-Cosmic-Biographics#The Tyrants|Tyrants]], but Eblis hated them for their lack of intervention in the war. Another war broke out and Melia Prime was destroyed.

Eblis plots underground, controlling mortals in hope of enacting his revenge.
