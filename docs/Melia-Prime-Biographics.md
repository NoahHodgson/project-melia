***Note: Half-Races get counted as human, since that is what their offspring will be***

## Kingdom of Westmere: 
Like 80% Human and 20% Mer. Standard medieval fantasy kingdom with a good friendship with
the people of Riverdeep. People are generally agreeable. Middling power level for country and its mages. People
generally worship the Mer-Gods or "The Pentatheon" (5 Gorumez).

## Kingdom of Haulfin: 
90% Human and ~10% other things. Smaller Kingdom. Mostly human and pretty mundane. Occassionally
sees outbreaks of monsters. People generally worship "The Pentatheon" or occasionally the Pact of Blood.

## Riverdeep: 
60% Mer and 40% Human. A confederation-state. Exists as a collaboration between Humans and Mer, don't
let it's land borders deceive you. The mer have settlements far out into the water. There are other Mer civs out
in the southern sea, but unlike Riverdeep they don't form traditional government. Most worship the Mer-Gods, while
some humans worship The Pentatheon.

## Umanite Empire: 
90% Human and ~10% other things. This empire is an organized body of warrior clans bound together
by the strength of the ruling family. Many of the clan families could form strong kingdoms on their own, but instead
remain loyal to the empire, waiting to strike when the moment is right to try and take the Throne of Golgotha.
Worship the Pact of Blood for the most part.

## Sulterian Empire: 
70% Human and 15% Mer and 15% Kwy. More Arab inspired. Lavish empire. Trade with everyone.
Religion of the region is patchwork, this includes a polytheistic one called Kara Hrashna.

## Grand Baroni of Geshud: 
80% Kwy, 5% Human, and 15% Pan. More interested in science. Not to keen on outsiders, but
after the resolution of the War of Horns has reluctantly allowed them in. They are still rebuilding from the war.
Worship "The Deep", but with not a lot of fervor.

## Grand Baroni of Aragona: 
80% Kwy, 15% Human, and 5% Pan. More interested in religion. Humans who venture to Aragona
come their to mainly become priests. The Kwy there remained neutral until the second half of the War of Horns, so
there is some resentment that remains between the two Grand Baronis, maybe even more than among those who made
peace. Worship "The Deep". The center of the religion is within Aragonan borders.

## Crysos: 
60% Pan, 30% Human, and 10% Kwy. Bore the brunt of the War of Horns. Crysos was once a pretty warlike land
but recently has converted to a more peaceful way of like. Like all Pan, the extended family is the nucleus of the
society. Ancestor and Nature worship "Circle of Life" is the primary religion, though some Humans still follow The
Pentatheon.

## Gladsia:
70% Pan, 25% Human, 5% Mer. More warlike than her sister nations, Gladsia's Pan are all about physical 
displays of strength. Family is still the important nucleus. 

## Plumia: 
80% Pan and 20% Human. Most peaceful and most isolate, Plumia is known for being deeply religious and 
spirtitual. The forests of Plumia are sacred to the "Circle of Life", which nearly every citizen upholds. The
Humans in Plumia are often at odds with the Pan natives.

## Dragonmark: 
40% Human, 15% Kwy, 15% Pan, and 30% Mer. Home of the dragons. People come from all over to visit,
convene, and worship the dragons even if some of them aren't so friendly. Humans and Mer settled Dragonmark long
ago under the protection of some friendly old dragons.

### ***NOT LISTED: FROST GIANT SOCIETY***
Don't have a traditional society. Since Frost Giants don't need food, only water, they never need to settle anywhere
though they chose the far north since that was far away from the "small folk" there language is a mix of guteral
noises, gestures, and eye movement. They nomadically wander the north looking for the meaning to their magical
existence.
