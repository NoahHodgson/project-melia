## The Before Time:
The last Yassuo dies, his skull splits open and The Creators spring forth.

Cheron, the painter of the afterlife, just exists.*

The Creators (mice) Used "Magic" (code)
to create and sculpt an uninhabited planet. Why they
did this is unknown. They did it though and seemingly
moved onto other projects out into the galaxies.
All they leave behind is the "magic" and life. This is
what happened.


## Melia Prime and Reign of Eblis:
For eons the original Melia was a 
chaotic world with many civilizations thriving and fighting.
Eventually Fiend Tyrant [[Eblis]] overran the world with foul monsters 
and his army of fiends, that he created. The Creators (mice)
don't really have time to keep an eye on things, however,  they
did take notice and eventually recognized the fate of the original
Melia. They recognized the Tyrant [[Eblis]] had destroyed what
could have been a prosperous planet and could have produced people
capable of participating in the "Cosmic Journey". Furthermore, his 
power was that which could rival The Creators, themselves.

The Creators don't have all the time in the universe on their hands. 
They also found it difficult to find/kill [[Eblis]]. They do recognize where his 
general dwelling place is: in the planets core. The Creators decide not to
let a hospitable planet go to waste. They decide to level the planet's
monster/fiend population by destructive magic. Many managed to escape 
and hid underground, but the [[Eblis]]'s horde was fractured. Next the 
creators managed to seal [[Eblis]] underground. Finally The Creators replenished
life on Melia Mar. The remaining monsters that remain, remenants of a bygone
era. Human Civilization pops up on the continents. They settle and repopulate
the earth. [[Steven]] one of the creators with less experience is promoted and Melia Mar
is put under his watchful eye.

## Era of the Passerbys:
As civilization progresses cities emerge and
are prone to much fighting. It's not very civilized.
As this is happening, beings from another realm are
doing interstellar travel and pass through Melia Mar.
These are what some civilizations would come to worship
as gods. They were immortal (at least in age compared
to humans) and often aided or formed some type of relations
with humankind. Some would help and pass through,
others would stay for awhile. The god of Eskillia in 
particular dwelled there until its much later fall. 
The god of Eskillia is known as "Eskil", but his true name
was "Nahralib Fuella". That does not translate easy into Eskillian.
Anyway, the era of these ethereal wanderers helped calm the
people as they began to think big picture on the future.

One people group, were the Tabradians. They witnessed The Creators
do magic. It is interwoven into their tradition. Mimicing The Creators
the Tabradians are able to use magic. Tabradians, for interstellar
context, are far ahead of the majority of species because the mice
got sloppy and were still cleaning up Melia Mar after dealing with [[Eblis]].


## Era of Silence:
After awhile almost all of the higher beings travelled 
beyond Melia Mar, much like The Creators before them.
Soon, accounts became religion and religions became myth.
Outside of Eskillia, not one higher-being, who made
themselves known remained on Melia Mar. In this era, 
the countries we know today + the War of the Mages happens

War of Mages: Roclesia attacks Tabradia-> Tabradia
easily handles the non-magic Rocevelen soldiers ->
Rocevelen's grow to hate "Tabi Witches" -> Rhalyf
betrays his people, and reveals the secret of magic
to Gomash -> Rocevelen and Tabradians fight a bloody
war. War ends in a unified continent ruled for centuries
by Gomash's descendents, and extended family tree.

In this era the Roclesian Empire and Sidio Barca have a healthy
trade relationship. Sidio Barca is nowhere near as strong as the
Roclesians, but also valuable enough not to outright conquer.

Meanwhile in the East, there was a history of conflicts. Eskillia
was the dominant super power. The Pavolians would often lead
raiding parties and there were battles in southern Eskillia.
Eskillia was also much larger than it's modern borders, so "southern
Eskillia" is now what part of Mildabia and Pevolia. In this
era Pavolia also had many wars against the princes of the east,
and these wars are known as the First War of Princes,
Second War of Princes, and the Final War of Princes, the result of
the final war being the three Princedoms, who often fought small
wars amongst themselves, banned together and formed a non-agression
pact to drive out the Pevolian horde. This alliance is the peak 
power of the princedoms, after this there power wained and they
fought amongst themselves eventually again. Mildabia is poor desert
land during this period. Not even a unified country. Here though,
is where the silence would end.

## Expanded Era:
Era of silence ends when the Agltthim descend from the sky
and encounter a Mildabian man. The Mildabian man is blinded by
their hideous faces. The Agltthim feel bad, and since wear masks
whenever they come to Melia Mar. They talk for a long time with
the blind man, who then becomes their "prophet", delivering a 
message that the Agltthim are the messengers of the gods, and 
"the prophet" has been sent to deliver the people of Mildabia from
poverty. The religion takes off like wildfire, especially after the
Agltthim start making public appearance with "the prophet". This
led to the formation of the Church of Diacci. "The Blind Prophet"
becomes the first high priest. Many more follow, each propped up
by visits from the Agglthim. Agglthim are Wanderers from a world
created after the old gods, and now pass through Melia Mar as did
the old gods, and possibly gods older than the old gods. The Agglthim
however are not as sophisticated, nor as mighty as the old gods.
Still, the Agglthim also may have connections to certain old gods/
multi-terrestrial beings. Many Agglthim have visited the high priest,
but the most well known are Lucien, Mikheali, and Ghabro. Some of the
less powerful Agglthim live amongst humans for a period of time, but most
choose to quietly pass through the world. The most powerful, names mentioned
above, remain suspended above the planet in a hidden palace. 

Meanwhile, "Eskil" gets mad because the new prince doesn't 
want to use the stone. There is way more to the story and both sides
are compelling. The Last Prince does not view[[Eskil]]as a benevolent
figure and sees him as a god who has ruled the kingdom from the shadows.
This is partially true, and the prince had the audacity to tell that to
"Eskil".[[Eskil]]reminds the Prince that he is a god. The Prince again
rebuffs the covenant that the princes of Eskillia had kept for tens of
generation.[[Eskil]]reveals his true name to the Prince. He reveals to the
prince the origins of universe, and that[[Eskil]]would be rash with his
punishment.[[Eskil]]turns the stone to dust, and inflicts the ashblight 
on the people of Eskillia. Furthermore he descends the massive (like we
are talking mountainsized) city of[[Eskil]]into the ground, puncture a vein
of underground caverns where monsters lie. Eskillia fell into ruins.
After a few genarations the Pevolians begin to conquer the southern lands
of Eskillia. 

A couple centuries later, Sidio Barcans discover Cuma Cura. Cuma
Curans tell them about a great civilization that lies in the far
east that used to come and trade with them also. This fuels many
expeditions. At first, SB's think continent is barren because of 
Ashblight state of the northern end of Berringia (plus Frost Giants).
Eventually they discover the rest of the Eastern Civilizations and
set up some trade routes. Around this time also, the Tabradian lands
gain independence as the structure of the Rocevelen royal family fell
apart, leading to the formation of the four houses, each an off-shoot
of the lineage of Gomash. Pavolia goes to war with the princes again,
but after two major battles, the Diacci Church intervenes and helps
establish a truce. The Church's influence continues to grow. 

After around 50-100 years of the trade routes truly being established,
the Rociaran League breaks free. Sidio Barcans are powerful enough
where the rest of the Rocevelen Empire does not want risk war with 
them. At this point world politics has begun and the East and West
know pretty well of the other. 

***Current Campaign Takes Place Around 10 Years of the Independence
of the Rociaran League ***

## Descent Era:
Next age to come. Agltthim come down and wreck things up. Nature of
the universe potentially revealed. Agltthim might try to free [[Eblis]].
