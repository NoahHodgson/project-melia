## Disambiguation: Tiers of Beings
* Tier 1: Sentient Life.
* Tier 2: Beings who have discovered atomic reformation, or know some multicasting and componentless casting.
* Tier 3: Can do both of the above and can perform interstellar travel.

# The Yassuo:
Ancient beings that originally existed. They were souls that existed without magic. They were eternal beings who almost all decided to cease existence. When the second to last one died, his skull split open and The Creators poured out. [[Cheron]] is the last one in existence, and she is the one who guides souls to rest in the afterlife.

# The Creators:
First magical creatures. Extradimensional beings. Little guys who look like mice. They created the universe using powerful magic. They have increased intelligence, but lack some social skills. They create life in order to observe how fast different types of creatures and planets could advance. The goal of the creations is to reach the center where the creations will be rewarded with eternal peace. 

# The First Melians:
Planet created towards the middle of the lifespan of the race project.
	It very occasionally go visitors. The people that lived on it were varied,
	but mostly general humanoids. There were the Melia-pan, who had ram-like horns.
	There were the Melia-mers who lived in the sea. The Melia-sha who dwelled on the
	beaches and in the field, generic humanoids. The Melia-Kwy, who dwelled 
	in the hills and were able to use incredible earth-stonoco; they had pupil-less green
	eyes, some had other colors and were adept with other magic. There was also giants in the frozen north. Some societies intermingled, but the Mers mostly kept to themselves. The Pan and the Kwy did fight some great wars though.

(Mers and Frost Giants were the only First Melians to survive the destruction event)

# The Gorumez:
The created beings who first visited the first Melians. They were humanoid but glowed
	translucently. They were powerful beings of magic, but could not communicate with
	the First Melians.

# The Dragons:
A race of beings that over time grew too weak to complete their cosmic quest. Settled 
	in quiet Melia Prime.

# The Kosol:
Kosol were reptilian-like people. They stopped in Melia Prime.
	They alternated between walking on 2 and 4 legs. They were seen as intruders
	in Melia Prime. Unlike other travelers, they lacked the tact to play gods 
	or anything divine. They also had a brash streak setting up a dominion in the
	center of Melia Prime. Some were known for killing Melians for on occasion fun.
	(Gorilla Lizards) Melians eventually started having fights with the Kosol. This led to the biggest
	war Melia ever faced. The Pan began to modify their genetics in order to get the
	upper hand over these lizards.

# The Tyrants:
Eventually the Pan modify their genetics so much they were considered a different
	species. They became large bounds of supra-dermis muscles that made them double
	or triple in size. Their horns also grow and there eyes also glow different colors
	depending on the element of stonoco they are connected too. This is because they used
	Kwy DNA in the formula. Transformation take a long period of time. Tyrants can have
	children, but they have a low likelihood of surviving. Note, not every Pan became
	a Tyrant. After the threat of the Kosol were contained (some died, others left to the next planet). Some Tyrants decided to become the new overlords of the planet. One such Tyrant, known as [[Eblis]] would bring destruction to the planet after learning and rebelling against The 
	Creators. Check [[Melia-Cosmic-History]].

# The Second Melians:
Second Melians are the ones currently in the "Fated Voyage" campaign. Not varied, unlike
	the First Melians. There DNA structure resemble the Melia-sha. The Tabradians do have a
	little bit more in common with the Kwy, but not enough to make them a different species.
	They populate the two continents and are still at tier one of the cosmic levels.

# The Terrans:
Terrans are lower power beings that made it to tier 2/3. They visited Melia for a time
	but most fairly quickly left. Some are still worshipped by the Second Melians as deities.
	Dennis for example is a Terran.

# The Ador:
Ador were higher power beings that made it to tier 3. They passed through Melia
	around the same era that the Terrans did. They have much greater power than the Terrans did,
	but still chose to play "the game". The god of the Eskillians is one example.

# The Verenfer:
Cosmic space worms. They have a small base that latches on to a living host and then a dozen
	or so heads that pop out from the head. They are parasites. Often they bury themselves deep
	within an intelligent host. However, controlling host requires severing the spinal cord.

They do this to gain control of a planet's leader or something of that nature. Did this to the Aglthiim.  

# The Aglthiim:
Angel people with wings. Society was unknowingly took over by the Verenfer. By the time they 
	realized it, it was too late. They continue the cosmic journey aware of what happened to their
	some of their most powerful leaders, but helpless to stop it.


# The Ctalans:
Cthulus but humanoid
