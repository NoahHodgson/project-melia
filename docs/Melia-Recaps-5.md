## Arc 5 Episode 1:
[[Oliviero]] and [[Eblis]]'s led an onslaught on the city of Bristok. They were not the first to arrive however. No the dragon [[Grihm]], one of the last of his kind already flew high over the city - seeking the material, made from the millennia old remains of a Creator. Oliviero, [[Raxus]], The Lady in Green, [[Gaelan]], and the [[The Red Herald]] began attempting to shoot the dragon out of the sky. He attempted to obliterate them with his fiery breath, but Oliviero casted meteor and knocked the dragon out of the sky. 

Meanwhile [[Lorenzo]] and [[Giocar]]'s crew noticed the explosion and split into 2 teams. Lorenzo would investigate the town and [[Giocar]] would lead [[Leon]], [[Ghost]], and the others to go find out what the explosion would be all about.

Oliviero froze the dragon in time with a stasis room and then banished it into the In-Between. His crew took on the people in the temple while he and the Lady in Green ran ahead to search for the weapon-component there. They found nothing.

Meanwhile, [[Leon]] and [[Ghost]], after some spying on Oliviero, decide to go investigate the castle, where Leon's family lived. On route, they found [[Tytactis]] who was also looking for the sword-component. Leon and Tytactis deepened their bond, to the objection of Ghost, and they continued to the castle. There Leon, met his parents and they equipped him with magic items and clues to help find the sword.

Lorenzo explored the city with [[Skee]] and collected clues until he surmised that the component must be under a large tree. He gave Skee a shovel and they started digging, with [[Chris]] sharing the information with the crew.  They found the component, but it was quickly stolen by the Lady in Green (who one-shot Skee, but did not break his ribs). Then Oliviero pilfered it from her. Lornezo hurled an icebolt to stop him, but missed. 

Fortunately for Team Lorenzo, Oliviero was headed off by Leon, Ghost, and Tytactis...

## Arc 5 Episode 2:
[[Brutus]] told [[Skee]] to run back to the ship, to escape the incoming battle.

[[Leon]] charged at [[Oliviero]], catching him off guard. Oliviero was only able to escape by casting a powerful spell that erased some of Leon's memories. [[Chris]] stole the component off of Oliviero.
Then the rest of Team Oliviero came in to aid their friend, [[Gaelan]] used his ravens to try to steal the component back and [[Raxus]] stepped in to protect a wounded Oliviero. An epic standoff. Leon was able to avoid Raxus and got a killer-blow in on Oliviero, but at that moment it became known that [[Eblis]] had taught Oliviero "atomic-regeneration" and Oliviero remained unconscious but alive. Slowly regenerating in the form of magical dust. [[Lorenzo]] scooped the dust of his old passenger up for safe keeping. 

The rest of Team Oliviero did not realize this and though Oliviero had died. Gaelan sobbed and Raxus launched a ferocious onslaught that was narrowly dodged by Leon. In the chaos of battle, [[Ghost]] finally attempted to fulfill her contract to kill Lorenzo. Her icy touch put Lorenzo within an inch of his life. Chris swooped into save him, dropping the bag with the component. Also in the bag, alongside the component for the sword was vials of Grade-2 Accelerant. 

The dropping of the bag, made the accelerant combust, causing a wide ranging explosion. This wounded Chris and many other combatants, including killing The Lady in Green. Also at this point, the sealing rune was broken by [[Grihm]] and he returned to Melia Mar seeking the component that he would use to bring the dragons back to greatness. Also [[Giocar]] was back and ready to finally enter the fray. 

Giocar, Leon, and Grihm all stared at each other, and then through the flames where the sword-component likely lay. This would not be a matter of brawn, but how nimble our combatants were. 

## Arc 5 Episode 3:
[[Giocar]], [[Leon]], [[Raxus]] and [[Grihm]] all rushed through the flames searching for the sword component. They brawled in the smoke and the flames. Seeing that the battle was going to leave everyone in too weak a state to maintain possession of the component, Leon and Grihm made an alliance. Together they took on Raxus, but Giocar was able to evade them and pick up the components. 
When he went to pick it up, he burned his hands instead. The heat from the explosion had heated the component up to the consistency of melted cheese. His hands scorched, Giocar fled to the trees empty handed.

Meanwhile, [[Lorenzo]] being badly injured had Chris fly him away from the battlefield and back towards the ship. He clutched the jar of Oliviero's essence under his arms. [[Ghost]] pursued the captain and the pterodactyl, seeking to finally collect her bounty. Finally Gaelan chased after Lorenzo. He sought out Oliviero's remains (not realizing that he would reform). 

It this point [[Oliviero]] consciousness is whisked away one last time to the In-Between. [[Eblis]] voiced his disappointment and told Oliviero that their collaboration was over. Oliviero had planned on betraying Eblis once he got the sword anyway, but this still stung a little. Oliviero was expelled from the In-between, leaving for the last time. Eblis sat and stewed for a bit. He decided with the sword so close, he'd go and risk it all to get the sword himself. He teleported back to Melia Mar, to Bristok, into the fray of battle. 

Grihm and Leon bested Raxus killing him off. At this point Eblis emerged and locked into combat almost immediately with Leon. Leon dipped his sword into the component and like magic it stuck.
With the help of [[Tytactis]], Leon was able to hold off Eblis's onslaught of attacks until [[Steven]] arrived. Steven hurled a bolt of light at Eblis causing him to flee back to the In-between, barely escaping with his life.

Steven reunited the party together, resurrected Oliviero, and rewarded Leon with an official post as wielder of the sword. Ghost was outed as an assassin by Steven and fled the scene. Grihm was rewarded for helping fight Eblis, and given magical food to help the dragons. 

Gaelan and Oliviero ride the cow off into the sunsets as they planned to start a magic college. Leon becomes a Creator-ally, to Tytactus's meh-ness. Lorenzo rides off on his ship, knowing his Uncle is his true father and also trying to kill him. Eblis's forces have taken much of the north pole from the frost giants, but their forces are weakened.

## Arc 5 Epilogue:
After 5 years, the war between Pevolia and Mildabia entered a ceasefire. Dragons hatched new eggs and baby drakes flew over the Berringia once again. The trade families continue to maintain power and [[Giocar]] even stronger, with [[Jhun]] as his right hand. Eskillia continued to suffer, as monster attacks from underground and from the north became more frequent. The Mer for the first time, have sent diplomatic envoys to the nations of the world revealing how advanced their society truly is. The Roclesian Empire fell further into disarray, allowing the two breakaway regions to become independent vassals. And in the north, the far north, the remaining Frost Giants fight Eblis's horde as they struggle to hold the north. Eblis remains in the In-between, fearing the day when Steven and The Creators finally come for him.
