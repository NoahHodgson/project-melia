## Arc 5 Episode 1:
[[Oliviero]] and [[Eblis]]'s led an onslaught on the city of Bristok. They were not the first to arrive however. No the dragon [[Grihm]], one of the last of his kind already flew high over the city - seeking the material, made from the millennia old remains of a Creator. Oliviero, [[Raxus]], The Lady in Green, [[Gaelan]], and the [[The Red Herald]] began attempting to shoot the dragon out of the sky. He attempted to obliterate them with his fiery breath, but Oliviero casted meteor and knocked the dragon out of the sky. 

Meanwhile [[Lorenzo]] and [[Giocar]]'s crew noticed the explosion and split into 2 teams. Lorenzo would investigate the town and [[Giocar]] would lead [[Leon]], [[Ghost]], and the others to go find out what the explosion would be all about.

Oliviero froze the dragon in time with a stasis room and then banished it into the In-Between. His crew took on the people in the temple while he and the Lady in Green ran ahead to search for the weapon-component there. They found nothing.

Meanwhile, [[Leon]] and [[Ghost]], after some spying on Oliviero, decide to go investigate the castle, where Leon's family lived. On route, they found [[Tytactis]] who was also looking for the sword-component. Leon and Tytactis deepened their bond, to the objection of Ghost, and they continued to the castle. There Leon, met his parents and they equipped him with magic items and clues to help find the sword.

Lorenzo explored the city with [[Skee]] and collected clues until he surmised that the component must be under a large tree. He gave Skee a shovel and they started digging, with [[Chris]] sharing the information with the crew.  They found the component, but it was quickly stolen by the Lady in Green (who one-shot Skee, but did not break his ribs). Then Oliviero pilfered it from her. Lornezo hurled an icebolt to stop him, but missed. 

Fortunately for Team Lorenzo, Oliviero was headed off by Leon, Ghost, and Tytactis...

## Arc 5 Episode 2:
[[Brutus]] told [[Skee]] to run back to the ship, to escape the incoming battle.

[[Leon]] charged at [[Oliviero]], catching him off guard. Oliviero was only able to escape by casting a powerful spell that erased some of Leon's memories. [[Chris]] stole the component off of Oliviero.
Then the rest of Team Oliviero came in to aid their friend, [[Gaelan]] used his ravens to try to steal the component back and [[Raxus]] stepped in to protect a wounded Oliviero. An epic standoff. Leon was able to avoid Raxus and got a killer-blow in on Oliviero, but at that moment it became known that [[Eblis]] had taught Oliviero "atomic-regeneration" and Oliviero remained unconscious but alive. Slowly regenerating in the form of magical dust. [[Lorenzo]] scooped the dust of his old passenger up for safe keeping. 

The rest of Team Oliviero did not realize this and though Oliviero had died. Gaelan sobbed and Raxus launched a ferocious onslaught that was narrowly dodged by Leon. In the chaos of battle, [[Ghost]] finally attempted to fulfill her contract to kill Lorenzo. Her icy touch put Lorenzo within an inch of his life. Chris swooped into save him, dropping the bag with the component. Also in the bag, alongside the component for the sword was vials of Grade-2 Accelerant. 

The dropping of the bag, made the accelerant combust, causing a wide ranging explosion. This wounded Chris and many other combatants, including killing The Lady in Green. Also at this point, the sealing rune was broken by [[Grihm]] and he returned to Melia Mar seeking the component that he would use to bring the dragons back to greatness. Also [[Giocar]] was back and ready to finally enter the fray. 

Giocar, Leon, and Grihm all stared at each other, and then through the flames where the sword-component likely lay. This would not be a matter of brawn, but how nimble our combatants were.
